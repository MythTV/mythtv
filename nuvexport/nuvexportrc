#
# nuvexportrc:
#
#  This file contains the configuration for nuvexport, and should be installed
#    as /etc/nuvexportrc.  You can also copy this file to ~/.nuvexportrc, where
#    nuvexport will look first, if you wish to create settings local to a
#    specific user.
#
#  support for nuvexportrc is still new, so expect that more default options
#    will be added as time goes on (so you'll know what you can edit).  In the
#    meantime, you can poke around in the code for add_arg() calls to see which
#    options are available.
#

#
#  Anything placed within the <nuvexport> section will be interpreted
#    as a global option.  Use this section for options that don't relate
#    specifically to any particular exporter.
#
<nuvexport>

#
#  Set export_prog to ffmpeg, transcode or mencoder, depending on your
#    preference of program for exports.  This is equivalent to --ffmpeg,
#    --transcode or --mencoder
#
    export_prog=ffmpeg

#
#  Any other parameters set in this file are equivalent to using the equivalent
#    setting as a commandline option.  For boolean options like --deinterlace
#    (--nodeinterlace), use deinterlace=yes (or no, true or false) instead.
#    Actual commandline options will override anything in this file.
#

#
#  Preferred mode -- if you don't set this, nuvexport will ask you what you
#    would like to do.  Use --mode or any of the mode symlinks (like
#    nuvexport-xvid) to override.
#
#    mode=xvid

#
#  Setting underscores to yes will convert whitespace in filenames to an
#    underscore character (which some people seem to prefer)
#
    underscores=no

#
#  Setting require_cutlist to yes will tell nuvexport to show only those
#    recordings that have a cutlist
#
#    require_cutlist=no

#
#  By default, nuvexport picks what it thinks is a good name for your file
#    (doing its best to avoid printing "Untitled" into the filename).  Setting
#    name will let you change the output format of the filename generated by
#    nuvexport.  Even after this formatting, nuvexport will still do some basic
#    replacements to make sure that illegal filename characters (eg. /\:*?<>|)
#    are replaced with a dash (or " with a ').  The following format variables
#    are supported:
#
#    %f -> full path to the filename
#    %c -> the chanid of the show
#    %a -> start time in YYYYMMDDHHMMSS format
#    %b -> end time in YYYYMMDDHHMMSS format
#    %t -> title (show name)
#    %s -> subtitle (episode name)
#    %h -> hostname where the file resides
#    %m -> showtime in human-readable format (see --date below)
#    %d -> description
#    %% -> a % character
#
#    name=%t - %s

#
#  By default, nuvexport uses an American-style date to represent showtimes in
#    lists and filenames.  Use --date to override that with the format of your
#    choosing.  See the UnixDate section `perldoc Date::Manip` for formatting
#    options.
#
#    date=%m/%d, %i:%M %p

</nuvexport>

#
#  The sections below work as above, with each more specific section overriding
#    the more generic.
#

<generic>

    path = .

    use_cutlist     = yes
    multipass       = yes

    noise_reduction = yes
    deinterlace     = yes
    crop            = yes

#
#  You can create settings for each export module type.  These are the
#    second-most generic sections, and will only be reached if there are no
#    matches in the full or generic module names.
#
#  If you have a particularly dirty signal, you might want to try to disable
#    fast_denoise (it's actually part of yuvdenoise, which both the ffmpeg
#    and transcode exporters call).  It can be almost twice as slow as the
#    default "fast" normal noise reduction, but it considerably more effective.
#
    fast_denoise = yes

</generic>

<ffmpeg>
#
#  ffmpeg is almost twice as fast if you disable noise reduction
#
#    noise_reduction = no
#
#  By default, nuvexport's ffmpeg module lets ffmpeg handle deinterlacing.
#    I've found that this provides the best results, but if you wish to let
#    yuvdenoise do it instead, set deint_in_yuvdenoise to a true value.
#
#    deint_in_yuvdenoise = no
#
</ffmpeg>

<transcode>

#
#  Setting always_use_mythtranscode to yes will force nuvexport to call
#    mythtranscode when using the transcode exporter.  This may help problems
#    that some people have been having with transcode not recognizing certain
#    dvb recordings.
#
#    force_mythtranscode=no

</transcode>

<mencoder>
</mencoder>

#
#  You can also create settings for generic export module names.  These will
#    only be overridden by full module names.
#

<XviD>

    vbr          = yes   # Enable vbr to get the multipass/quantisation options
                         # (enabling multipass or quantisation automatically enables vbr)
    multipass    = yes   # You get either multipass or quantisation; multipass will override
    quantisation = 6     # 4 through 6 is probably right...  1..31 are allowed (lower is better quality)

    a_bitrate    = 128   # Audio bitrate of 128 kbps
    v_bitrate    = 960   # Remember, quantisation overrides video bitrate

    width        = 624   # Height adjusts automatically to width, according to aspect ratio
    height       = auto

</XviD>

#
#  Default mp3 bitrate is 128
#
<MP3>
    bitrate = 128
</MP3>

#
#  If you want to provide settings for a very specific export module, you can
#    use its full name, and it will override any more generic settings.
#

<mencoder::XviD>

    multipass = no
