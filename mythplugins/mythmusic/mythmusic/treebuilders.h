/** \class MusicTreeBuilder
    \brief superclass for the objects that build trees of \p Metadata
    
    This is the interface for objects that builds trees of \p Metadata
    objects into \p MusicNode objects.

    The basic idea of operation is, that the superclass provices a
    makeTree method that depends on the subclasses for a few methods
    to determine which fields of the metadata objects are used in
    building the tree and where the metadata objects go.

    This means that the superclass is fairly generic and does not
    itself operate on or query the metadata objects, but leaves that
    to the subclass. It's only responsibility is to determine the
    branches that go into the tree and then add metadata objects as
    leafs to the appropriate nodes.

    Ie. if you wanted to build the MythMusic tree based on the size of
    the audio files by implementing a \p MusicSizeTreeBuilder, the
    approach would be to get \p MusicSizeTreeBuilder::getField return
    the number of MB or KB blocks depending on the current depth as
    obtained by \p getDept. Then you could either overload \p makeTree
    to stop at a certain depth (like \p MusicFieldBuilder does) or
    make \p MusicSizeTreeBuilder::isLeafDone return true if you've
    reached the desired granularity.

    \note This method is fairly generic, and uses very little of the
    interfaces of \p MusicNode and \p Metadata, so it may someday be
    made more generic and of use to other plugins that needs trees.

    \note Calling this repeated using the same or new instance on the
    same root node (ie. to progressively populate it) hasn't been
    tested.
