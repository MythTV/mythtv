                             MythMusic 
                           Release 0.17


BUILD/CONFIGURATION INSTRUCTIONS
--------------------------------

First, you need MythTV to be installed.  At the very least, you need MythTV's
database stuff setup properly.  If you don't have that done, don't even bother
with this, as it won't work.

In addition to MythTV's requirements, you'll need these software packages:
(note: _all_ of these exist as software packages in Debian).

   MAD - mp3 decoder library, and its libid3tag library.  
         http://www.mars.org/home/rob/proj/mpeg/

   Vorbis - I've just used this with version 1.0.  You'll need a full install,
            encoding and decoding support.  http://www.vorbis.com

   FLAC - lossless encoder/decoder.  Version >= 1.0.4 is needed.
          http://flac.sourceforge.net

   libcdaudio - Used to play CDs and to hit FreeDB for CD information.
                I'm using 0.99.9.  http://libcdaudio.sourceforge.net

   cdparanoia - The integrated ripping support uses the libraries from this.
                I'm using cdparanoia III 9.8.  http://www.xiph.org/paranoia/

Optionally:

   fftw   - A very nice library for Fast Fourier Transforms (helps analyze
            audio data for playback visualizations). Currently using 2.1.3.
            Don't use version 3. http://www.fftw.org/

   OpenGL - Just about everyone should have this already (?). 
            http://www.opengl.org

   SDL    - Simple DirectMedia Layer library. Needed for some of the
            visualizations. Currently using 1.2.5
            http://www.libsdl.org

   FAAD   - Free Advanced Audio Decoder. Needed for AAC/MP4 support.
            Currently using 2.0.0. 
	    http://www.audiocoding.com

            __NB__: As of March 5, 2004, you can build and install FAAD2 v2.0
            final, but you must manually copy mp4ff_int_types.h from faad2/common/mp4ff/
            to your usr/local/include/ directory.

Phew.  Lotta stuff required. If you're having problems, please check both
the documentation and the mailing list archives at http://www.mythtv.org

Ok.  Once you've got all the prerequisites installed, on to compiling.
There's a configure script in the main distribution directory, but it does
not check for all of the above packages. It's just a tiny little script that
lets you turn on and off support for the fftw, OpenGL, and SDL libraries. Run it
with './configure --help' to see what you can set.

Now type 'qmake mythmusic.pro' then 'make' in the main distribution directory. 

Compiling note:  If you get an error on building this, that says something
                 about 'mkspecs', then you don't have the QTDIR environment
                 variable set.  On Debian, this should be set to /usr/share/qt.
                 On Mandrake, it's /usr/lib/qt3.  You'll need to figure
                 out what it should be on your system, set the variable,
                 and attempt to compile again.

If you get any errors about missing references, etc, you most likely don't have
one of the required pieces of software installed.

Follow this by a 'make install'.  It'll put a 'libmythmusic.so' plugin in your
/usr/local/lib/mythtv/plugins directory.

MythMusic will also read the mysql.txt settings file used by MythTV, so any 
changes you made to those will be carried over into this.

You'll want to go into the Music Settings section of the Setup item from 
mythfrontend and set at least the path where your music is stored.

Once it's done searching for your music, the interface will show up.  It should
be fairly easy to figure out.   Check out the HOWTO for details.
