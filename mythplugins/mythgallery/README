                                  MythGallery
			         Release 0.17


There'll be more information here later, but for now:

BUILD/CONFIGURATION INSTRUCTIONS
============================================================================

Requirements:
-------------

1) First, you need MythTV to be installed.  At the very least, you
need MythTV's database stuff setup properly.  If you don't have that
done, don't even bother with this, as it won't work.

Compiling:
----------

OK, on to compiling.

1) Configure the package by typing ./configure in the main
distribution directory. You can enable OpenGL support using
./configure --enable-opengl
(make sure you have OpenGL support for your graphics card available
and enabled if you choose this option. You can check this under X11
using xdpyinfo or glxinfo. Also ensure that QT has been built with
OpenGL support)

You can also enable EXIF support using
./configure --enable-exif
This requires you have the libexif headers/libraries installed and in your
include/lib path when compiling.  An install of the libexif/libexif-devel
packages from your favorite package repository usually provides this.
Current, EXIF support only consists of auto-rotating images if the camera
sets the orientation tag (My Canon S400 does)

2) Next type 'qmake mythgallery.pro' then 'make' in the
main distribution directory.

Compiling note:  If you get an error on building this, that says something
                 about 'mkspecs', then you don't have the QTDIR environment
                 variable set.  On Debian, this should be set to /usr/share/qt3.
                 On Mandrake, it's /usr/lib/qt3.  You'll need to figure
                 out what it should be on your system, set the variable,
                 and attempt to compile again.

If you get any errors about missing references, etc, you most likely don't have
one of the required pieces of software installed.

3) Follow this by a 'make install'.  It'll put a 'libmythgallery.so'
plugin in your /usr/local/lib/mythtv/plugins directory.

MythGallery will also read the mysql.txt settings files used by
MythTV, so any changes you made to those will be carried over into this.

Configuration:
--------------

After compiling and installing, you will need to enter the setup menu from
mythfrontend to configure mythgallery; change the directory parameter to
where you're storing your pictures.

USAGE:
============================================================================

This should be really simple to use -- just browse around with the
arrow keys and select images/directories to view with the space/enter
keys.  Escape backs out a level, and hitting 'p' while viewing a
single image or while an image icon is highlighted will start a
slideshow playback of all images in that directory.  Image rotation
can be done by pressing the [ and ] keys. To toggle activating the
menu on the left in the thumbnail view use the 'm' key.

When IMPORT is pressed in the menu each item in the import directory
search path will be examined.  If the item is a directory, its
contents will be recursively copied to a new directory whose name is
the current date and time.  Using this method, removable devices can
be put in the search path if they use an automount system (see the
Linux documentation for info on how to use automount systems).  If the
item is an executable file, it will be executed with 1 argument
consisting of the name of the new subdirectory.  This way, import from
a removable device can be accomplished without the use of an automount
system.
