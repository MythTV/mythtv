1. About
========

   MythBrowser is a full fledged web-browser (multiple tabs) to display webpages
in full-screen mode. Simple page navigation is possible. Starting with version 0.31
it also has full support for mouse driven navigation (right mouse opens and closes
the popup menu).

   MythBrowser also contains a BookmarkManager to manage the website links in a
simple mythplugin.



2. Installation
===============

2.1 Prerequisits
----------------

You have to have the KDE development package installed.


2.2 Compilation/Installation
----------------------------

qmake
make
make install


3. Usage
========

  First you have to enter the MythBrowser Settings to define your favorite
webpages and groups. This is also where you can adjust the zoom level of the
fonts on the webpages as well as define the command to execute mythbrowser
(default: PREFIX+/bin/mythbrowser). The Zoom Level is a percentage between 
20 (smaller text) and 300 (larger text).  Check 'Scroll Page' to drag the 
page within the background when moving the mouse while holding 'Alt' or 
pressing the middle button.  If 'Scroll Page' is unchecked then the 
background will be dragged instead of the page.  Set the 'Scroll Speed' 
to a value according to how fast you want this mouse-scrolling to 
scroll.  Then exit setup.

  In the MythBrowser screen you can then select a webpage to display. If
you select (SPACE/Enter) on a group the browser will be startet with all
the websites in that group in a different tab (you can switch between the
tabs with the 'Pause' key).


Page Navigation:

  Cursor Left		Prev Link (eventually in the prev frame)
  Cursor Right		Next Link (eventually in the next frame)
  ESC       		Exit
  Return		Return (i.e. follow the link)
  Cursor Up/Down	Scrolling
  PageUP/Down		Scrolling
  Pause			Switch to new tab
  PrintScreen		Popup Menu

  Right mouse button    Popup Menu
  
  MouseScroll + MidBut  Scroll Page/Background (depending on settings) 
  MouseScroll + AltBut  Scroll Page/Background (depending on settings)
  WheelScroll + MidBut  Zoom Page 
  WheelScroll + AltBut  Zoom Page 

The popup menu (PrintScreen Button) allows to switch between tabs as well.
Furthermore it features a Back menu item, as well as a zoomin and zoomout
menu. Last but not least you can store the current link in the bookmarks
via the popup menu.


4. Hints
========

I recommend you reconfigure .lircrc so that the myth activation button
issues a 'Return' rather than the 'Space' key-event.
Add the 'Pause' key to your .lircrc in order to enable fast switching
between different tabs. Alternatively you can also map the popup menu
key to your remote. The popup menu allows to switch to the next/prev
tab. Furthermore it enables you to go back in the link history and to
store a link in the bookmarks.

begin
    prog = irxevent
    button = Key_of_your_choice
    config = Key Pause CurrentWindow
    repeat = 3
end

or

begin
    prog = irxevent
    button = Key_of_your_choice
    config = Key Print CurrentWindow
end



5. TODO
=======

- Add OSD message 'Loading... 45%'

- Add to the popupmenu:
   + Open Link in New Tab
   + Mouse Emulation Mode

- Make it themeable
