3. Usage
========


Use the arrow keys and PAGEUP, PAGEDOWN, PAGELEFT, PAGERIGHT to scroll around
the webpage.

ZOOMIN/ZOOMOUT will increase/decrease the size of the text.

You can follow a link by first using NEXTLINK/PREVIOUSLINK to highlight the
link you wish to follow then press FOLLOWLINK to show the linked page.

MOUSEUP/MOUSEDOWN/MOUSELEFT/MOUSERIGHT allows you to move the mouse pointer
using your remote control. MOUSELEFTBUTTON simulates clicking the left mouse
button allowing you to click on a link for example.

MythBrowser is a tabbed browser. You can use PREVTAB/NEXTTAB to change tabs
and DELETETAB to remove the current tab. You can add a new tab from the popup
menu. You can move the focus to the tab widget by pressing INFO which allows
you to use the LEFT/RIGHT arrows to quickly change tabs. Press INFO again to
return the focus to the active web page. If you add more than one URL to the
command line a tab will be created for each URL added.

To view a page Press MENU and choose 'Enter URL'. Enter the URL of the page
you want to view. There is no need to add the 'html://' MythBrowser will add
that for you if missing.

MythBrowser will remember the pages visited and allow you to return to them by
pressing HISTORYBACK/HISTORYFORWARD.

Most actions can be accessed from the popup menu (Press MENU).

4. Hints
========

The F1 key selects where the keyboard input does to. If a web page requires
some sort of input, like an edit control used to enter a search term, pressing
F1 allows you to send all input to the web page. Pressing it again allows
MythBrowser to again capture keyboard input.

You can get smoother mouse pointer movement by lowering the repeat count for
the remote keys used for mouse emulation in your lircrc config file.
