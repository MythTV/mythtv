This module provides a number of old themes for MythTV that used to be
distributed in the main download.

Please edit myththemes.pro to point to your current mythtv installation prefix.
This is generally /usr/local if you're compiling from source.

To install:

$ ./configure
$ qmake myththemes.pro
$ su
# make install
