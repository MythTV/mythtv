# Crappy parser.  Only uses a comma to delineate the end of a line, so
# all comments must end with a comma. A single quote inside a comment
# also screws up the parsing.
#
# The goal is to pass all of the following:
#
#     bugprone-*
#     cert-*
#     clang-analyzer-*
#     cppcoreguidelines-*
#     misc-*
#     modernize-*
#     performance-*
#     readability-*
#
# Some specific checks may never be enabled, like
# clang-analyzer-security.insecureAPI.strcpy which requires a missing
# library to fix problems.  Others like modernize-redundant-void-arg
# seem unnecessary.  Some others may never be enabled by default, like
# clang-analyzer-core.CallAndMessage which doesn't understand
# dynamic_cast and gives lots of false positives.
