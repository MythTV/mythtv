About:
------

This theme is originally based on G.A.N.T. by Oscar Carlsson and 
is inspired by the well-known Media Center theme.

I found the MythTVMediaCenterOSD osd theme by Jason Gabriele to go best 
with this theme, but of course this is merely a matter of taste. 
Maybe I will do an OSD theme in the future too.
