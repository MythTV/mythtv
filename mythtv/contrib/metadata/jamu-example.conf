# Configuration file
# Author: 	R.D. Vaughan
# Version: 0.1.0 - Initial alpha release
# Version: 0.2.0 - Initial beta release
# Version: 0.3.1 - MythTv meta data maintenance added
# Version: 0.3.2 - MythTv unicode URL's fixed and variable "min_poster_size" had '=' instead of ':'
# Version: 0.3.3 - Regex string format change. Also obsolete variables removed.
# Version: 0.3.4 - Added a IMDB variable as a second source parameter
# Version: 0.3.5 - Added a folderart option to turn Jamu's creation of folder cover art on.
# Version: 0.3.6 - Added sections [mb_tv] and [mb_movies] for the -MW to get graphics for Miro videos.
# Version: 0.3.7 - Prepopulated the following sections with values to help new users:
#                  "season/movie name overrides section", "episode name massaging section" and
#                  Miro additional graphics section". Also updated the docunentation for secondary
#                  sources.
# Version: 0.3.8 - Added the 'filename_char_filter' variable to allow additional characters to be replaced

# This config file contains variables the user can modify through option "-C" configuration filename.
# To see all variable names and their current values run "jamu -f" from the command line.
# Once you make changes, verify those changes by running "jamu -f" again.
# This file is an example, copy and rename (e.g. jamu.conf) so that the next distribution does
# not clobber your personal settings.
# You can have multiple configuration files with different names that have settings for specific tasks.

# START  variables section---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# All variables a user can modify are listed below with their default values. To change a variable
# remove the leading '#' and change the value (after the ':'). Limited editing of the values is
# performed so be careful. Without caution you can certainly cause jamu to fail/abort.
# NOTE: Do not surround any value data with quotes even if it contains spaces.
#       e.g. the directory name "/home/my dir/my posters" is expressed as value /home/my dir/my posters

# START season/movie name overrides section --------------------------------------------------------------
#####
# PURPOSE: Override series/movie names to reduce the need for manual interaction
#          and more accurate matching with thetvdb.com TV series or themoviedb.com wiki.
#
# FORMAT:
# Any line starting with "#" is treated as a comment
# Any blank line is ignored
# All other lines must have two fields in this specific order:
# 1st) The series/movie name or the %TITLE% field as passed by MythTV and a trailing ':' character
# 2nd) The thetvdb.com series id (SID) or themoviedb.com imdb number as specified for the
#       series/movie on thetvdb.com or themoviedb.com wiki. This will override the series/movie
#       name to eliminate the need for manual interaction.
# NOTE: Included here, are examples of current (2009) TV shows that Schedule Direct
#       has different TV series names than what is on thetvdb.com wiki. If you are searching for
#       series based on the Schedule Direct names as MythTV does then the wrong TV series will be
#       identified. You can pick the correct series by using interactive mode but this does not
#       help with unattended processing. This section allows you to specify the correct TV series
#       on thetvbd.com despite the name in Schedule Direct. Luckily there are not many TV series
#       that require overrides.
#       The only time themoviedb.com is referenced is when the (-M) option is used and a
#       video files name does not have season and episode numbers. Those video files are
#       assumed to be movies.

# FORMAT:
# Any line starting with "#" is treated as a comment
# Any blank line is ignored
# All other lines must in the following format:
# 1st) The series name or the %TITLE% field as passed by MythTV and a trailing ':' character
# 2nd) Pairs of values separated by commas. The first value is the search text to match to text within
#      the episode name such as the %SUBTITLE% field passed by MythTV and the text to replace the
#      matched searched text. If the replacement text contains a space then surround that text with
#      the '"' double quotation characters.
#      E.g. "24": PM," PM", AM, " AM" will turn the episode name

# START  Miro additional graphics section -----------------------------------------------------------
# By default mirobridge exclusively uses the Miro meta data and graphics (Channel icon or
# video icon and video screenshot), when adding a Miro video to either MythTV and MythVideo.
# In a very few instances there may be graphics (Posters, Banners and/or Fan art) that are available
# and relevant to a Miro video. These instances consist of Movie Trailers and video casts for TV shows.
# Recently some Vidcasts have been added to TVDB e.g. "HD Nation".
# In these cases better quality metadata/graphics may be available from either themoviedb.com or
# thetvdb.com
# In this section:
#     For TV shows you can specify a Channel name and thetvdb.com reference number. The TV series "Nova"
#     "Nature" examples have been provided.
#     For movie trailers just the Channel name is required plus the channels movie title delimiter
#     character.
#
# When a Channel has been specified in either the Movie or TV sections Jamu's -MW option will check the
# relevant source (themoviedb.com or thetvdb.com) for better graphics. If found they will be downloaded
# and used in place of the lower quality Miro graphics.
# To utilize this feature the you must run the Jamu option -MW.
#
# The examples below are already activated. If you are not using Miro no additional processing happens.
# The Channel names MUST be exactly as you have specified in
# your Miro configuration. These examples may not match the Channel names in your Miro configuration.
# For Movie trailers there will be a maximum of three attempts to find the correct movie.
# The first attempt will assume that the movie is to be released in the current year. If there is no
# match the second and third attempts will assume the movie will be released in the coming years.
#
# To add more channels the format is always channel title then a ":"
# Each Channel requires its own line, you cannot have multiple Channels per line.
# NOTE: Do not surround any Channel name with quotes even if it contains spaces.
#       e.g. the Channel name "HD-Trailers.net Blog" is expressed as value: HD-Trailers.net Blog
# NOTE: For movies a movie title delimiter character must be specified. For example the subtitles for
#       two movie trailer sites are listed below. The delimiter character is consistent for a channel:
#       1) Timo's HD Movie Trailers: "Cirque Du Freak: The Vampire's Assistant - QuickTime Trailer"
#          The delimeter character for the movie titles from Timo's is a "-"
#       2) HD-Trailers.net Blog "Surrogates (Trailer 2)"
#         The delimeter character for the movie titles from HD-Trailer.net is a "("
#
# The TV format is Channel name ":" then thetvdb.com reference number

# START Secondary sources section--------------------------------------------------------------------
# NOTE: This section is only active in conjunction with the Mythmetadata (-M) option
# Purpose:
# The primary sources of graphics and meta data for Tv Series and Movies are thetvdb.com and
# themoviedb.com respectively. Sometimes these sources do not have the requested metadata or graphics.
# This section allows you to add secondary sources when the primary come up empty.
# Secondary source requirements:
# 1) A secondary source must have a command line interface such as "fetch_poster.py".
# 2) The format of the returned values (through stdout) must match that of the existing grabber
#    scripts such as tmdb.pl, tmdb.py and ttvdb.py.
# 3) You must specify the fully qualified name of the secondary source (path and filename)
# 4) You must specify the command line switches that the secondary source requires to get specific data
# 5) You must specify the dynamic data required by the secondary sources. Dynamic data is from a
#    restricted set specified below.
#
# NOTE: The secondary source for meta data (textual data) is used as an attempt to fill in missing
#       data for a video file. The primary source and the secondary source data is combined
#       to complete as much information as is available between the two sources. The primary
#       source always takes precedence.

# Dynamic data:
# %%(inetref)s      - This can be a thetvdb.com series id, TMDB number, IMDB ...etc. This is equal to
#                     the mythdb table 'videometadata' field 'inetref'.
# %%(imdb)s         - Specifies an IMDB number whether or not the inetref is already an IMDB number.
#                     This variable is required as in most cases the inetref will be a TMDB number but
#                     most secondary sources still require an IMDB number. NOTE: Despite the source
#                     of the graphics files the naming convention is always "inetref.ext". This value
#                     is exclusive to what Jamu assumes is a movie file after parsing the video file
#                     name. It cannot be used for TV series secondary source.
# %%(file_seriesname)s - This can be a TV series name or movie name.
# %%(subtitle)s     - This is usually a TV series episode name (Not included for movies)
# %%(seasno)d       - This is a TV series season number
# %%(epno)d    		- This is a TV series episode number
# %%(filename)s     - This is the video file name as found on your computer
# %%(filepath)s 	- This is the fully qualified video path (mainly for user scripts)
# %%(ext)s 			- This is the video file extention (e.g. "mkv") with no "."
#
# The secondary sources are split into a movie section and a TV series section.
# Tv series are defined as any video file names that contain season and episode numbers.
# The type of data is specified by the key value.
# Valid keys are:
# poster   - This is also know as a cover art or a cover image
# fanart
# banner   - At this time only TV series have banners. FYI - tmdb.pl refers to fanart as a banner.
#            If you add a 'banner' key to the movie section it will be ignored.
# metadate - The video file's text description e.g. plot, director ... etc
#
# NOTE: At this time there is no TV Secondary source scripts available unless you write your own.

# START regex section------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# NOTE: If you do not understand regex expressions DO NOT USE this section.
# This section adds to the default regex strings used to parse file names when extracting
# the following: series name, season number, episode number
# NOTE: The "% (self.config['valid_filename_chars_regex'])" part of the string is assumed
# NOTE: ANY % percent sign in the expression must be doubled (e.g. a % must be changed to %% )
# NOTE: The key value (e.g. "regex01") must be unique for each value.
# NOTE: DO NOT surround the regex pattern string with the traditional ''' three single quotes
#
[regex]
# This is an example video file name "foo_S01_12" where:
# series name is "foo", season number starts at "S" and episode number starts after '_'
# foo_S01_12
#regex01: ^(.+?)[ \._\-][Ss]([0-9]+)_([0-9]+)[^\\/]*$
# END   regex section------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# START ignore dirctory section--------------------------------------------------------------------
# This section allows users to identify Video subdirectories that Jamu should ignore when processing.
# These directories and the sub-directories will not have any of their video files processed.
# The deirectories must be absolute paths relative paths will be ignored. Each directory path is preceeded
# by a "ignoreXX:" value do not have duplicates as one of the duplicates will be ignored.
# NOTE: Do not surround any of the directory paths with quotes even if they have spaces in the names
# NOTE: Jamu does not validate that the directories you are valid on your system so make sure they are correct

#ignore01: /path to/videos/to be ignored
#ignore02: /path to/more videos/to be ignored
