        Minor adjustments to key timings and retries

1.6, 2003-10-31
	Try 5 times instead of 4, and increase timeouts by 50% after
	second failed attempt to change channel.

1.5, 2003-10-26
	Wait for extra status messages after changing channel; without
        it, clearing the OSD would usually fail because we wouldn't
        know the proper sequence number
	
	Serial port is now locked properly to prevent multiple copies
        of channel from running.  If the port is locked, a new
        instance will wait up to 30 seconds for the lock to go away.

1.4, 2003-10-20
	Added new commandline options:
	      -f to ignore some errors during initialization
	      -n to never send KEY_POWER
	      -b to act just like the old Python script

1.3, 2003-10-18
        Removed autoconf/automake to cut down size

1.2, 2003-10-17
	Non-GPL code rewritten from scratch; now uses
	autoconf/automake and has more command line options.

1.1, 2003-10-08
	Minor improvements and bugfixes

1.0, 2003-10-07
	Initial release
