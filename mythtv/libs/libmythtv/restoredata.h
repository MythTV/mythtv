 * Description:
 *     Postprocessing of channelscan result
 *
 * When all channels are deleted and a new scan is done then
 * all the non-scanned data is lost.
 * This are the following fields:
 *     xmltvid    Channel identification for XMLTV including Schedules Direct
 *     iconpath   File name of icon for this channel
 *     visible    Visible status
 * When a channel is deleted it is not immediately deleted from the database;
 * it is kept for a while with the "deleted" field set to the date at which it
 * is deleted.
 * This makes it possible to retrieve this data from the deleted records
 * when the same channel is found again in a new scan.
