Where pk means PRIMARY KEY, uk means "UNIQUE KEY", and k means "KEY".
BUSQ refers to the Big Ugly SQL Query in scheduler.cpp

\section capturecard_table Capure Card Table (capturecard)
This table describes the attributes of a capture card used by MythTV.

The primary key 'cardid' is automatically generated by the database.

The 'videodevice' field normally points to a device used to capture
the video, but for DVB where multiple devices are used it is simply
a number indicating which set of devices do use. The 'audiodevice'
is only used by framegrabber cards, encoding cards like the Haupauge
PVR line encode the audio as part of the video stream, while DTV
cards like the various ATSC and DVB cards recieve the audio as part
of the video stream. The same applies to the 'vbidevice', PVR and
DTV cards have captions encoded in the digital stream, while
framegrabber cards use this device to provide caption and other
data to MythTV.

The 'audioratelimit' field is used to set the audio capture rate
when using the 'audiodevice' field. This is mostly useful for
V4L cards that have troublesome on-board audio, such as some
cards supported by the bttv driver.


The 'cardtype' is an important field for all cards as it guides the
interpretation of the rest of the fields, it has several possible
values: "V4L", "MJPEG", "DVB", "MPEG", "FIREWIRE", and "GO7007".
"V4L" indicates a V4L compatible device, this could be a
true V4L device or something like a Firewire camera with the
"firewire->v4l" driver.
"MJPEG" describes a Matrox G200 or DC10 card which captures
individual frames a JPEG images.
"DVB" can describe any card supported by the Linux DVB
drivers, including the pcHDTV and other ATSC cards.
The "MPEG" type describes a device using the ivtv drivers such as
the Haupauge PVR[150,250,350,500]s +Freestyle cards, the Yuan MPEG
series, the Avermedia M179, and the Adaptec VideOh! AVC-2410.
The "FIREWIRE" card type does not describe Firewire cameras of
capture cards but instead describes the Firewire port required by
law in the USA on cable boxes for subscribers who recieve HDTV
channels and request the Firewire port feature. This port lets
you communicate with your cable box without needing to build an
IR transmitter; in some cases, it also allows you to digitally
capture video.
The "GO7008" card type describes a USB MPEG-4 encoder such
as the Plextor ConvertX.

The 'hostname' field is another important field for all cards
as it specifies which backend the capture card is connected to.

The 'defaultinput' field is a another important field for all
cards except "FIREWIRE", "FREEBOX", "HDHOMERUN", and "IMPORT" cards.
It specifies which
input of the card to use. This does not have to mean a specific
physical input, but may also indicate a different use for the
same phyicial input.

The 'signal_timeout' and 'channel_timeout' indicate in
milliseconds how long it should take to get a signal and
channel lock respectively.

The 'dvb_swfilter', 'dvb_sat_type', 'dvb_wait_for_seqstart',
'skipbtaudio', 'dvb_on_demand', and 'dvb_diseqc_type' columns
are all "DVB" specific configuration parameters.

Both 'dvb_recordts' and 'dvb_hw_decoder' are unused, and
will be dropped in future versions of MythTV.

The 'firewire_port', 'firewire_node', 'firewire_speed',
'firewire_model', 'firewire_connection' are all "FIREWIRE" specific
configuration parameters. The first three define the connection,
and function much like 'videodevice' does for other capture "cards".
The 'firewire_model' describes the cable box model, for example
"DCT-6000" decribes a box that communicates using the same protocol
as the Motorola DCT-6000. The 'firewire_connection' field descibes
the overall communication protocol, i.e. are we using "Broadcast"
or "Point-to-Point" communication.

\section dtv_multiplex_table Digital Television Multiplex Table (dtv_multiplex)
This table contains the information needed to tune to a particular
frequency on a particular input.

The primary key, 'mplexid', is automatically generated by the database.
The most important field is the 'frequency' field which contains the
transmission frequency in Hertz. The 'sourceid' which tells us which
card and on what input of that card this multiplex applies to according
to the \ref videosource_table. Along with a channel number 'sourceid'
also uniquely identifies a channel in the \ref channel_table. The
'modulation' field tells us whether the modulation mode is "qpsk",
"qam_16", "qam_32", "qam_64", "qam_128", "qam_256", "8vsb", "16vsb",
or "auto". Finally, the 'sistandard' field is the last field which
applies to both DVB and ATSC, it contains on of four strings, "dvb",
"atsc", "mpeg" or "opencable".

When describing a DVB Multiplex, the networkid, and transportid are
used along with the serviceid in the \ref channel_table to tune to
a particular MPEG stream in DVBChannel.

When descrining an ATSC Multiplex, the \ref channel_table contains
the major and minor channels used to tune to a particular stream.

Other fields are used by different DVBx implementations to tune to a
a particular type of service and MythTV just passes them along to the
drivers to take care of.



\section dtv_privatetypes_table Digital Television Private Types Table (dtv_privatetypes)
This table contains free form data pertaining to DVB services, it is
like a settings table for DVB.



\section videosource_table Video Source Table (videosource)
This table tells us about a particular input on a video capture card.

The primary key, 'sourceid', is automatically generated by the database.
The 'name' field gives the input name as passed to the video capture card
driver. The 'xmltvgrabber' field tells us where we get our listings from.
The 'userid' and 'password' fields are optionally used to log in to a
listings service, with the 'lineupid' being used to select a particular
lineup available from the listings service. Finally, the 'freqtable'
tells us which channel number to frequency mapping to use with
analog channels, us, us-cable, pal, etc.



\section channel_table Channel Table (channel)
The primary key, 'chanid' is generated by combining the source id with
a unique number from 0 to 99.

The 'channum' field contains the channel number to be input to jump
to a channel.

The 'sourceid' field contains the \ref videosource_table key, which
specifies which listings service to use and which input on which video
capture card to find this channel.

The 'callsign' field contains the government mandated licence number
of the channel's broadcaster if this is an over-the-air channel.

The 'name' field provides the alphanumberic name of this channel for
use in the %MythTV user interface.

The 'icon' field provides the path to an optional channel icon for this
channel.

The 'freqid' field provides the channel number to tune to, as
differentiated from the 'channum' used in the %MythTV user interface.
When the 'mplexid' is set it is used instead. And the 'finetune' field
is used to adjust the frequency provided by the combination of 'freqid'
and 'tvformat', this can be used when there is carrier drift in a cable
system.

The 'xmltvid' field is used to identify this channel to the listings
provider.

The 'tmoffset' field is used to apply an offset (in minutes) from the listings
provided by the provider to a new time in the MythTV program guide database.
This is very handy when the listings provider has listings which are offset
by a few hours on individual channels with the rest of them being correct.

The 'recpriority' field is used tell the scheduler from which of two
otherwise equivalent programs on two different channels should be
prefered, a higher number means this channel is more preferred.

The 'tvformat' is one of "ntsc", "ntsc-jp", "pal", "atsc", etc and is used
for various purposes, such as translating a channel number to a frequency,
setting the recording frame size, etc.

'commfree' tells us whether this is a commercial free channel, such as
those on the BBC and CBC networks. On commercial free channels we
do not need to run the commercial detector.

'commmethod' tells us which commercial flagger to use on the channel, the
default is to use the global setting

'visible' tells us whether we should show this channel in the channel
guide.

'outputfilters' contains a list of filters that should be applied
when playing recordings from this channel.

The 'contrast' 'brightness', 'colour', and 'hue' fields are used by frame
grabbing recorders to adjust the picture before encoding each frame.
And, 'videofilters' contains a list of filters that should be applied
when recording from channel using a frame grabbing recorder.

For digital television, the 'mplexid' field contains the
\ref dtv_multiplex_table key for determining additional digital tuning
parameters. The 'serviceid' field contains the MPEG program number when
describing a DVB service. The 'useonairguide' field is used by DVB to
determine whether to use the on-air-guide data from this channel to
update the listings.

\section program_table Program Entry Table (program)
'category_type' holds one of these exact four strings:
"movie", "series", "sports" or "tvshow".

'airdate' is a string representing the year of release for movies and
may have no meaning for other types of shows.

'stars' is a floating point number from 0.0 to 1.0. On a four star scale,
1.0 would be four stars, 0.75 would be three stars and so on.

'originalairdate' if provided is the date when a show was, or will be,
first televised.

'previouslyshown' is a field created by MythTV to try to determine if
a showing is more than 14 days after its original air date or if the
show was marked as a repeat and did not have a date for the first
airing. If this is "0" it usually means that this is a brand new show
or a rebroadcast within the first two weeks.

'programid' is the Tribune Media Service database record identifier
for each program description. In general, these start with a two
letter prefix, MV, EP, SP or SH that equate to the 'category_type'.
For most, the last four digits are "0000" except EP where the last
four digits are the episode number in the series. Note that these
are generated by TMS and not the show's producers but they are
usually in the same order as the original air dates for the episodes.
Detailed information can be found in the Data Direct documentation
at http://labs.zap2it.com/ .

\section oldrecorded_table Old Recorded Table (oldrecorded)

oldrecorded imposes the restriction of one entry per
title, starttime and callsign.  The scheduler relies on this when
restoring any previous status for programs that aren't currently
recording and for catching reactivation requests.

The duplicate field is used to indicate if this record should be used
to check for duplicates in the BUSQ

\section oldfind_table Old Find Table (oldfind)

If a matching entry exists in
the oldfind table, the program is considered a duplicate regarless of
the duplicate setting in recorded and oldrecorded.  oldfind is an
imperfect optimization to avoid greatly increasing the time needed for
the big scheduler query.

But the real reason for oldfind is that a search
rule may not be able to match by title. For instance, a FindWeekly
"Bill Murray (People Search)" needs to know that "Meatballs" is a
dup for this week if "Stripes" has already been recorded. Oldfind
tracks if the rule (recordid) has recorded in the current time
interval (findid). When a recording has a findid, ForgetHistory()
and DeleteHistory() update oldfind while updating oldrecorded.

\section recorded_table Recorded Table (recorded

The duplicate field is used to indicate if this record should be used
to check for duplicates in the BUSQ
