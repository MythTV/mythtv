/*! \class TVPlaybackState
 * \brief Tracks current playback state, as signalled by the player, and requests
 * changes to the current state.
 *
 * Requesting player state changes is, by necessity, granular. Corresponding feedback
 * of new state is however signalled in small, functionally similar/associated groups
 * of state. This is to minimise the complexity of the API.
 *
 * \note The TV and player objects both operate within the main thread. As such
 * all signalling should be synchronous and hence the state should always be current.
 * \note Do not trigger additional code when state updates are received - as this
 * may lead to a feedback loop and/or recursion.
