/** This is a wrapper around QThread that does several additional things.
 *
 *  First it requires that you set the thread's name which is used for
 *  debugging.
 *
 *  It adds RunProlog() and RunEpilog() which are called automatically
 *  when you don't override run(), but must be called explicitly if
 *  you do. These take care of setting up logging and take care of
 *  dealing with QSqlConnections which are per-thread variables.
 *
 *  It also adds some sanity checking to the destructor so a thread
 *  can not be deleted while it still running.
 *
 *  Optionally it can be given a QRunnable to run in MThread::run()
 *  instead of calling QThread::run() (which starts an event loop.)
 *  When you override MThread::run() or use a QRunnable you are
 *  responsible for stopping the thread, MThread::exit() will not
 *  work.
 *
 *  Warning: Do not statically initialize MThreads. C++ itself
 *  doesn't allow you to specify the order of static initializations.
 *  See: http://www.parashift.com/c++-faq-lite/ctors.html#faq-10.15
