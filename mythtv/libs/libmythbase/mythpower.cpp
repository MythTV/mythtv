/*! \class MythPower
 *
 * MythPower is a reference counted, singleton class.
 *
 * Classes wishing to listen for or schedule power events should acquire a reference
 * to MythPower via AcquireRelease using a suitable Reference and Acquire set to true.
 *
 * AcquireRelease will always return a valid pointer but the default implementation
 * has no actual power support.
 *
 * If the class in question wishes to register a delay so that it can safely
 * cleanup before shutdown/suspend, it should pass a MinimumDelay (seconds) to
 * AcquireRelease. The MythPower object will then attempt to delay any events
 * for at least that period of time. This behaviour is not guaranteed - most
 * notably in the case of externally triggered events. The actual delay attempted
 * will be the maximum of those registered and, in the case of user initiated
 * events, the EXIT_SHUTDOWN_DELAY user setting (which defaults to 3 seconds).
 *
 * There is no method to subsequently alter the delay. Should this be needed, release
 * the current reference and re-acquire with a new MinimumDelay. To ensure the
 * underlying MythPower object is not deleted, take a temporary reference with
 * AcquireRelease using a different, unique Reference value.
 *
 * Do not acquire multiple references with the same Reference value. This will lead
 * to unexpected delay behaviour.
 *
 * To release the MythPower reference, call AcquireRelease with the same Reference
 * (typically a pointer to the owning class) and Acquire set to false.
 *
 * To check supported power behaviours, call either GetFeatures or IsFeatureSupported.
 *
 * Call RequestFeature to initiate shutdown/suspend etc. The default behaviour is
 * to delay the action.
 *
 * Call CancelFeature to cancel a previously scheduled shutdown/suspend.
 * \note CancelFeature is currently untested and may be removed. It is unclear
 * whether it is useable. As soon as the feature is requested, various system
 * processes start to shutdown. This often renders the GUI either unresponsive or
 * simply not visible. Hence trying to show a cancel dialog is pointless.
 *
 * Signals
 *
 * WillShutdown etc are emitted in advance and provide the listener with an
 * opportunity to do stuff. There is no guarantee on how long they have.
 * ShuttingDown etc are emitted when the requested feature (or system event) is
 * imminent. There is, in theory, no time to do stuff.
 * WokeUp is emitted when the system has been woken up OR when a scheduled event
 * has been cancelled.
 *
 * \todo Add OSX subclass
 * \todo Add Windows subclass
 * \todo Add Android subclass
 * \todo Add sending Myth events as well as emitting signals.
