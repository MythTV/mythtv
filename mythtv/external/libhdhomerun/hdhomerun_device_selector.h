 *   to be allocated by other computers.
 *
 * Channel change (active -> active):
 * - If the new channel has a different signal source then call hdhomerun_device_tuner_lockkey_release()
 *   to release the lock on the tuner playing the previous channel, then call
 *   hdhomerun_device_selector_choose_and_lock() to choose and lock an available tuner.
 * - If the new channel has the same signal source then call hdhomerun_device_tuner_lockkey_request()
