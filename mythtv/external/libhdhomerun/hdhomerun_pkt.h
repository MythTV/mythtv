/*
 * The discover protocol (UDP port 65001) and control protocol (TCP port 65001)
 * both use the same packet based format:
 *	uint16_t	Packet type
 *	uint16_t	Payload length (bytes)
 *	uint8_t[]	Payload data (0-n bytes).
 *	uint32_t	CRC (Ethernet style 32-bit CRC)
 *
 * All variables are big-endian except for the crc which is little-endian.
 *
 * Valid values for the packet type are listed below as defines prefixed
 * with "HDHOMERUN_TYPE_"
 *
 * Discovery:
 *
 * The payload for a discovery request or reply is a simple sequence of
 * tag-length-value data:
 *	uint8_t		Tag
 *	varlen		Length
 *	uint8_t[]	Value (0-n bytes)
 *
 * The length field can be one or two bytes long.
 * For a length <= 127 bytes the length is expressed as a single byte. The
 * most-significant-bit is clear indicating a single-byte length.
 * For a length >= 128 bytes the length is expressed as a sequence of two bytes as follows:
 * The first byte is contains the least-significant 7-bits of the length. The
 * most-significant bit is then set (add 0x80) to indicate that it is a two byte length.
 * The second byte contains the length shifted down 7 bits.
 *
 * A discovery request packet has a packet type of HDHOMERUN_TYPE_DISCOVER_REQ and should
 * contain two tags: HDHOMERUN_TAG_DEVICE_TYPE and HDHOMERUN_TAG_DEVICE_ID.
 * The HDHOMERUN_TAG_DEVICE_TYPE value should be set to HDHOMERUN_DEVICE_TYPE_TUNER.
 * The HDHOMERUN_TAG_DEVICE_ID value should be set to HDHOMERUN_DEVICE_ID_WILDCARD to match
 * all devices, or to the 32-bit device id number to match a single device.
 *
 * The discovery response packet has a packet type of HDHOMERUN_TYPE_DISCOVER_RPY and has the
 * same format as the discovery request packet with the two tags: HDHOMERUN_TAG_DEVICE_TYPE and
 * HDHOMERUN_TAG_DEVICE_ID. In the future additional tags may also be returned - unknown tags
 * should be skipped and not treated as an error.
 *
 * Control get/set:
 *
 * The payload for a control get/set request is a simple sequence of tag-length-value data
 * following the same format as for discover packets.
 *
 * A get request packet has a packet type of HDHOMERUN_TYPE_GETSET_REQ and should contain
 * the tag: HDHOMERUN_TAG_GETSET_NAME. The HDHOMERUN_TAG_GETSET_NAME value should be a sequence
 * of bytes forming a null-terminated string, including the NULL. The TLV length must include
 * the NULL character so the length field should be set to strlen(str) + 1.
 *
 * A set request packet has a packet type of HDHOMERUN_TYPE_GETSET_REQ (same as a get request)
 * and should contain two tags: HDHOMERUN_TAG_GETSET_NAME and HDHOMERUN_TAG_GETSET_VALUE.
 * The HDHOMERUN_TAG_GETSET_NAME value should be a sequence of bytes forming a null-terminated
 * string, including the NULL.
 * The HDHOMERUN_TAG_GETSET_VALUE value  should be a sequence of bytes forming a null-terminated
 * string, including the NULL.
 *
 * The get and set reply packets have the packet type HDHOMERUN_TYPE_GETSET_RPY and have the same
 * format as the set request packet with the two tags: HDHOMERUN_TAG_GETSET_NAME and
 * HDHOMERUN_TAG_GETSET_VALUE. A set request is also implicit get request so the updated value is
 * returned.
 *
 * If the device encounters an error handling the get or set request then the get/set reply packet
 * will contain the tag HDHOMERUN_TAG_ERROR_MESSAGE. The format of the value is a sequence of
 * bytes forming a null-terminated string, including the NULL.
 *
 * In the future additional tags may also be returned - unknown tags should be skipped and not
 * treated as an error.
 *
 * Security note: The application should not rely on the NULL character being present. The
 * application should write a NULL character based on the TLV length to protect the application
 * from a potential attack.
 *
 * Firmware Upgrade:
 *
 * A firmware upgrade packet has a packet type of HDHOMERUN_TYPE_UPGRADE_REQ and has a fixed format:
 *	uint32_t	Position in bytes from start of file.
 *	uint8_t[256]	Firmware data (256 bytes)
 *
 * The data must be uploaded in 256 byte chunks and must be uploaded in order.
 * The position number is in bytes so will increment by 256 each time.
 *
 * When all data is uploaded it should be signaled complete by sending another packet of type
 * HDHOMERUN_TYPE_UPGRADE_REQ with payload of a single uint32_t with the value 0xFFFFFFFF.
