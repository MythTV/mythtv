[00:35.62]I never thought I'd see the day
[00:38.42]I thought that I had finally moved along
[00:43.80]And I had let you go so long ago, so long
[00:49.26]This is not, this is not where I belong
[00:57.38]So I wait for this shallow itch to pass
[01:05.98]And I wait, yeah I wait
[01:12.14]Hey hey, I'm ok
[01:15.18]I don't need this anyway, I'm fine
[01:19.82]What's yours and mine
[01:23.64]Oh oh, I don't know
[01:26.44]What I was ever hoping I would find
[01:31.66]But it's time for me to leave this all behind
[01:35.74]
[01:46.20]I don't regret a single thing
[01:48.98]I couldn't say it didn't feel alright
[01:54.10]But I don't want to stay and I don't want to fight
[01:59.76]All alone, with my foolish appetite
[02:07.94]So I wait for this shallow itch to pass
[02:16.52]And I wait, yeah I wait
[02:22.72]Hey hey, I'm ok
[02:25.68]I don't need this anyway, I'm fine
[02:30.38]What's yours and mine
[02:34.12]Oh oh, I don't know
[02:36.98]What I was ever hoping I would find
[02:42.28]But it's time for me to leave this all behind
[02:45.36]I don't have the heart to give away to you again
[02:51.08]I don't have the stomach for it, no one ever wins
[02:56.70]We had our fun but I have sung this song to you before
[03:01.68]Here's my last refrain
[03:08.05]Hey hey, I'm ok
[03:10.81]I don't need this anyway, I'm fine
[03:15.50]What's yours and mine
[03:19.31]Oh oh, I don't know
[03:22.11]What I was ever hoping I would find
[03:27.34]But it's time for me to leave this all behind
[03:30.81]Hey hey, I'm ok
[03:32.98]I don't need this anyway, I'm fine
[03:38.02]What's yours and mine
[03:41.91]Oh oh, I don't know
[03:44.54]What I was ever hoping I would find
[03:50.04]But it's time for me to leave this all behind
[03:54.82]
