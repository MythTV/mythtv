This code was resynced upstream to:

git://source.ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg.git at n3.0-1-g0aa2fbd on February 19th, 2016 (jya) (release/3.0 branch, release 3.0)
git://source.ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg.git at n3.0-3-gb80083a on February 26th, 2016 (jya) (release/3.0 branch, release 3.0)

git://source.ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg.git at n3.4.1-5-g4a53ecb on February 5th, 2018 (Peter Bennett) (release/3.4 branch, release 3.4.1)

As of May 22 2018 we resync the code to the MythTV fork of FFmpeg (git@github.com:MythTV/FFmpeg.git).
All changes to the FFmpeg code must be made in that repository, master branch and cherry-picked to release branch currently in use.

git@github.com:MythTV/FFmpeg.git at n4.0-43-ge4e7472e73 on May 24, 2018 (release/4.0 branch)

I am no longer documenting each merge here. To find merge history use "git log mythtv/external/FFmpeg".

Procedure for FFmpeg resync
===========================

- In your MytTV/mythtv clone, master branch, get up to date
git pull
- Clone MythTV FFmpeg fork into a new directory:
git clone git@github.com:MythTV/FFmpeg.git
- create a branch to track the latest ffmpeg release branch (e.g release/4.2)
git branch --track release/4.2 remotes/origin/release/4.2
- Add a remote for main FFmpeg
git remote add ffmpeg git@github.com:FFmpeg/FFmpeg.git
git fetch ffmpeg
- Look for any changes that are in MythTV FFmpeg since last sync.
  In your mythtv directory.
git log mythtv/external/FFmpeg/
- If the log contains any changes check if they are in the MythTV/FFmpeg repository
  and if not commit them into MythTV/FFmpeg/master
  For each one:
    in mythtv directory
        git show <commit-hash> > commit_n.patch
    in FFmpeg directory
        git apply -p 4  commit_n.patch
  Then commit the result and cherry-pick into the current release branch (e.g. release/4.x).
- Check for a new branch. From FFmpeg clone directory:
git branch -a
- Check list from above command to see if there is any new release branch in 
  remotes/ffmpeg that is not in remotes/origin.

- If there is a new branch ffmpeg/release/x.x:
  - find its base as follows:
  git merge-base remotes/ffmpeg/master remotes/ffmpeg/release/x.x
  - Take note of the commit hash returned. Merge up to that commit as follow:
  git checkout master
  git merge <commit-hash-from-above>
    suggested comment - Merge from FFmpeg up to branch point of x.x
  - Create new branch with the name of the new branch found
  git checkout -b release/x.x
  - Merge the rest of master
  git checkout master
  git merge ffmpeg/master
  - Merge new branch   
  git checkout release/x.x
  git merge ffmpeg/release/x.x
  - Only push this after validating everything is ok (see below)
  git push origin -u release/x.x

- If there is no new branch:
  - Merge updates with the latest branch in use:
  git checkout master
  git merge ffmpeg/master
  git checkout release/x.x
  git merge ffmpeg/release/x.x

- Checkout release/x.x and in MythTV directory checkout master.
- Delete entire FFmpeg directory structure from MythTV directory and copy
  in the contents of the ffmpeg repository (except for the .git directory).
- Test MythTV build and playback.
- Add and commit all changes with comments identifying
  ffmpeg/FFmpeg Release/x.x description (git describe)
  MythTV/FFmpeg Release/x.x description (git describe).

- Push all branches you updated to MythTV/FFmpeg

This file (README.sync) will no longer contain details of each FFmpeg resync

Procedure for making FFMpeg changes
===================================

- Apply changes to the MythTV/FFmpeg repository, master branch.
- Cherry-pick them into the MythTV/FFmpeg repository, release/4.3 branch.
- Copy the code into the MythTV/mythtv repository, master branch

Note: The code in MythTV/mythtv repository master branch, FFmpeg directory is a copy of the code
in MythTV/FFmpeg repository, latest branch. so after making changes in MythTV/FFmpeg
repository and cherry-picking into release/4.3 you can just copy the modules over
into the MythTv/mythtv repository master branch without fear of losing any changes.
