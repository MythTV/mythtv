            │ RELEASE NOTES for FFmpeg 5.1 "Riemann" LTS │
            └────────────────────────────────────────────┘

   The FFmpeg Project proudly presents FFmpeg 5.1 "Riemann" LTS, about 6
   months after the release of FFmpeg 5.0, our first Long Term Support
   release. While several past FFmpeg releases have enjoyed long term
   support, this is the first release where such an intention is made
   clear at release.

   A complete Changelog is available at the root of the project, and the
   complete Git history on https://git.ffmpeg.org/gitweb/ffmpeg.git

   We hope you will like this release as much as we enjoyed working on it, and
   as usual, if you have any questions about it, or any FFmpeg related topic,
   feel free to join us on the #ffmpeg IRC channel (on irc.libera.chat) or ask
   on the mailing-lists.
