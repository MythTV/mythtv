Remote Controls
---------------

If you are using MythTV with just a remote control then it is suggested that you
map the remote control keys as described below.  Your remote control may not
have the same set of keys as those named below, the names are only a suggestion
that roughly correspond to the function.

If you are adding new key bindings to the program then consideration of this
suggested list will help users with remote controls.

This list assumes a minimal remote control that only has 20 keys, nearly all
features can be used with this configuration.  If you have more keys then you
can access all of the features.  With only 16 keys most features are usable.
