Lyrics Grabbers
===============

You can add your own grabbers to this directory and MythMusic will
automatically use them so long as they comply with the other grabbers.

The grabber should support these command line options :-

Options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -v, --version         Display version and author
  -t, --test            Perform self-test for dependencies and do an example search.
  -s, --search          Search for lyrics.
  -a ARTIST, --artist=ARTIST
                        Artist of track.
  -b ALBUM, --album=ALBUM
                        Album of track.
  -n TITLE, --title=TITLE
                        Title of track.
  -f FILENAME, --filename=FILENAME
                        Filename of track.
  -d, --debug           Show debug messages


-h, --help: will show the options as above

-v, --version: should output some version xml to stdout like this

            <?xml version='1.0' encoding='UTF-8'?>
            <grabber>
                <name>EmbeddedLyrics</name>
                <author>Paul Harrison and 'ronin'</author>
                <command>alsong.py</command>
                <type>lyrics</type>
                <description>Search tracks tag for embedded lyrics</description>
                <version>0.1</version>
                <priority>100</priority>
                <lrc>True</lrc>
            </grabber>

            Important elements used by MythMusic are <name> used to display and find the correct grabber to use
            and <priority> used to determin the order the grabbers will be used to perform a search.

-t, --test: should test for any unusual dependencies and also perform a
            search for a known track to make sure everything is working.

            Exit with '1' for error or '0' for success.

-s, --search: is the default option and can be ommited. It should do a search
              for some lyrics using the ARTIST, ALBUM, TITLE and FILENAME
              options as required.

              Exit with '1' for error or not found or '0' for success.

              The grabber should output to stdout an xml file with the result of the search
              like this :-

              <?xml version='1.0' encoding='UTF-8'?>
              <lyrics>
                  <artist>Robb Benson</artist>
                  <album>Demo Tracks</album>
                  <title>Lone Rock</title>
                  <lrc>True</lrc>
                  <grabber>FileLyrics</grabber>
                  <lyric>One, two, three, four</lyric>
                  <lyric>It wasn't until the wood stove fire was too big</lyric>
                  <lyric>Burn down house</lyric>
                  <lyric>Silent</lyric>
                  <lyric>Almost causing another sleepless night</lyric>
                  <lyric>Almost causing another sleepless night</lyric>
                  <lyric>But answers can be so real</lyric>
                  <lyric>Can be so real, can be so real, can be so real</lyric>
                  <lyric>Each lifetime leads to the next</lyric>
                  <lyric>I question do you believe</lyric>
                  <lyric>Many hour of suffering will be over</lyric>
                  <lyric>And once again you will learn</lyric>
                  <lyric>I miss your stories and your laughter</lyric>
                  <lyric>Memories count, memories count</lyric>
                  <lyric>I miss your stories and your laughter</lyric>
                  <lyric>Memories count, memories count</lyric>
                  <lyric>But answers can be so real</lyric>
                  <lyric>Can be so real, can be so real, can be so real</lyric>
                  <lyric>Can be so real, can be so real, can be so real</lyric>
              </lyrics>

-d, --debug: This option should turn on extra debug output
