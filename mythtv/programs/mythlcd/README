1.0 About
=========

	MythLCD is a little toy application that demonstrates how to use an
lcddevice which is an object available in libmyth. 


2.0 Installation
================

	First place to start is with a working copy of the LCDproc package,
which you can find at or around:

		http://www.lcdproc.org	

	There are links from that URL to sites where you can order LCD
hardware that works with LCDproc. Note that even if you don't have hardware,
you can easily build a curses version of LCDproc that will let you
use/debug/play with mythLCD code and see the results in a terminal. This can
be surprisingly useful, as it's an easy way to see the status of a mythbox
on the display of another computer.
 
	****IMPORTANT****: You need to enable LCD output in mythfrontend in order
for this to work. The "Enable LCD display" setting is on the last page of the
"Appearance" settings wizard.

	Once LCDproc is up and running, go into programs/mythlcd and type
make. Now just run the program (i.e. ./mythlcd). There is no "make install".
Note that the Makefile is hand assembled and has nothing to do with higher
level MythTV Makefiles.

3.0 FAQs
========

Q: What's the point of a tiny little program that is not part of any mythTV
executable code?

A: It's a useful reference for people who want to incorporate LCD device
output to their myth* software (e.g. mythGame, mythWeather, etc.).


4.0 Plans/TODO
=============	
	
	Make more modules use the interface.
