<P>Get MythTV from the 
<A HREF="http://www.mythtv.org">http://www.mythtv.org</A> web site.  There are two installation methods
you may choose from.  The first is to download the latest release in tarball
format and compile, but this is really only valid if you're reading this
HOWTO on the very first day that a new release has been made, because the
tarball is a static file and won't include any fixes for issues discovered
after the tarball was created.</P>
<P>The recommended solution is to download the source using
<B>subversion</B> to ensure that you've got the latest fixes.</P>
<P>When using subversion, there are some other choices that need to be made:
<UL>
<LI>Do you want to run the stable release of MythTV?  If yes, download from the "release-0-23-fixes" branch.</LI>
<LI>Do you want to run the absolute latest developer code?  If yes, you <EM>must</EM>
join the 
<A HREF="http://www.mythtv.org/mailman/listinfo/mythtv-commits/">http://www.mythtv.org/mailman/listinfo/mythtv-commits/</A> and 
<A HREF="http://www.mythtv.org/mailman/listinfo/mythtv-dev/">http://www.mythtv.org/mailman/listinfo/mythtv-dev/</A> mailing lists to
keep up to date with the current status of the code.  Code obtained from
subversion has no guarantees regarding stability, etc.  The latest code will be in "trunk".</LI>
</UL>
</P>
<P>If you are in North America you will use the Schedules Direct grabber which is
built-in to MythTV.  You <EM>do not</EM> need to install XMLTV (so you may
skip XMLTV-related instructions), but you need <B>wget</B> version 1.9.1
or higher.</P>
<P>Get XMLTV from 
<A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/projects/xmltv/files/">http://sourceforge.net/projects/xmltv/files/</A>.  Download the latest version (0.5.51).</P>

<H2><A NAME="ConfigureSD"></A> <A NAME="ss5.1">5.1</A> <A HREF="mythtv-HOWTO.html#toc5.1">Configuring the Schedules Direct service </A>
</H2>

<P>Schedules Direct is a non-profit organization which has licensed
Television program data from Tribune Media Services and makes it
available to users of Freeware and Open Source applications.</P>
<P>If you wish to use Schedules Direct, you'll need to establish a user
account.  Go to 
<A HREF="http://www.schedulesdirect.org">http://www.schedulesdirect.org</A> and click on the "Membership" link.</P>
<P>Once you've read and agreed to the Subscriber Agreement, Terms of Use and
Privacy Policy proceed to the lineup choices and configure your account for
your particular location and the channels that you have.  This configuration
will be imported into MythTV when you first run the <B>mythtv-setup</B>
program.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss5.2">5.2</A> <A HREF="mythtv-HOWTO.html#toc5.2">Manually building MythTV</A>
</H2>

<P>If you are going to use <B>subversion</B>, execute the following
instructions to obtain the latest <EM>trunk</EM> version of MythTV.</P>
<P>To use the <EM>release</EM> version, you can execute the following.  You are
strongly encouraged to use the release version.</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
$ svn co http://svn.mythtv.org/svn/branches/release-0-23-fixes/ mythtv-0.23
$ cd mythtv-0.23
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>To download trunk:</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
$ svn co http://svn.mythtv.org/svn/trunk/ mythtv-trunk
$ cd mythtv-trunk
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P><B>NOTE</B>:  Using a svn version of the code allows you to stay
up-to-date with changes.  So, if there's an update to the 0.23 release and
you originally obtained it using svn, you could enter the
mythtv-0.23 directory and type "svn up", which will update your copy
with the fixed version from the website.  You would then recompile and
install the updated 0.23 code.</P>
<P>If you are using the tarball, then unpack it:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
$ tar -xjf mythtv-0.23.tar.bz2
$ cd mythtv-0.23
$ ./configure
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>If you wish to change options, run <B>./configure --help</B> to
see what is available and to override any automatically detected options.
See the <CODE>config.log</CODE> file after running <B>configure</B> to see
previous runs.</P>
<P>To compile:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
$ make -j 2
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>The MythTV compile can take advantage of multiple CPUs, SMP and
Hyperthreading.  If you want to build MythTV on a multi-CPU machine (or with
<B>distcc</B>), specify "-j numjobs", where "numjobs" is greater than 2.
In the above example, we had two concurrent jobs executing, which is
recommended for a single CPU system.  Do not set the number of jobs too
high, or your compile will actually take longer to complete than it would if
you did a "normal" build.</P>
<P>Once the compile is done, switch to superuser:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
$ sudo bash
# make install
# exit
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>

<H3>Enabling real-time scheduling of the display thread.</H3>

<P>MythTV supports real-time scheduling of the video output thread. There
are three ways to go about enabling this: You can use rlimits, you can use
the realtime security module, or on older systems you can SUID the
executable. Enabling real-time scheduling is optional, but can make the
video display smoother, especially if you are decoding HDTV.</P>

<H3>rlimits</H3>

<P>The rlimits method is the preferred method and is included in Linux
2.6.12 and above and requires PAM version 0.79 or above.  Assuming anyone
running <B>mythfrontend</B> is in the audio group and rlimits are
supported, all you need to do is place this in your
<CODE>/etc/security/limits.conf</CODE></P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
*               -       rtprio     0
*               -       nice       0
@audio          -       rtprio     50
@audio          -       nice       0
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>

<H3>realtime module</H3>

<P>The second option is to use the Linux realtime kernel module.
This will be phased out over time, but is currently supported
by many distributions that do not yet support rlimits. If you are
not using the distribution kernel you must configure your kernel
with:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
Security options : [*] Enable different security models
Security options : [M] Default Linux Capabilties
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

You may also need to install the realtime module, using your distribution's
realtime package. Assuming the users who will be running
<B>mythfrontend</B> will be in the audio group you can get the GUID of a named
group like so:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
$ grep audio /etc/group
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

If the number printed out from the grep was 18, you can now load
this module as root before starting <B>mythfrontend</B>:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
# modprobe realtime gid=18
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>

<H3>run as root option (not safe)</H3>

<P>The final and least preferred option is to set the sticky bit
on the <B>mythfrontend</B> executable. This <B>opens a security hole</B>,
but is the only option on systems that do not support either
rlimits or the realtime module. This does not work on modern
distributions either, and is <B><EM>not recommended</EM></B>
on any system connected to the Internet. This may also make it
impossible to debug MythTV without running <B>gdb</B> as root. If you
would still like to do this, do the following as root:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
# chmod a+s /usr/local/bin/mythfrontend /usr/local/bin/mythtv
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>

<H3><A NAME="frontend-only"></A> Frontend-only configuration </H3>

<P>Since MythTV uses a client/server architecture, multiple frontend
computers can simultaneously access content on a Myth system.  Live TV,
watching and scheduling recordings, etc. are all possible from multiple
frontends.</P>
<P>To get a better picture of what is needed to run a frontend, note the
following:
<LI>You do NOT need the MySQL server installed on your remote frontend</LI>
<LI>You do NOT need XMLTV installed on your remote frontend</LI>
<LI>You do NOT need to run the mythtv-setup program on
your frontend machine</LI>
</P>
<P>Other than the exclusion of the MySQL server and XMLTV, the MythTV
compilation procedure is the same as when you're setting up both a backend
and a frontend.  However, you <EM>will</EM> need to install the database
access libraries.</P>
<P>Once MythTV is compiled and installed:
<LI>Run the mythtv-setup program on your Master backend. Under the "General"
menu, change the IP address of the current machine (by default, "127.0.0.1")
to the real external IP address - 127.0.0.1 is the internal loopback address and no
external machine can access it. Change the Master Server IP setting to the
same IP address as well.</LI>
<LI>Run the mythfrontend program on your frontend machine,
and a "Database Configuration" screen should appear.
Set the "Host name" field to point to your Master backend's IP address.</LI>
