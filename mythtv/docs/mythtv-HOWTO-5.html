<P>Get MythTV from the 
<A HREF="http://www.mythtv.org">http://www.mythtv.org</A> web site.  There are two installation methods
you may choose from.  The first is to download the latest release in tarball
format and compile.  The tarball release of MythTV should work on a wide
variety of systems and should be the preferred method for new users.  If you
wish to use the <B>subversion</B> copy of MythTV you may obtain it from
<A HREF="http://svn.mythtv.org">http://svn.mythtv.org</A></P>

<P>If you are in North America you will use the Schedules Direct grabber which is
built-in to MythTV.  You <EM>do not</EM> need to install XMLTV (so you may
skip XMLTV-related instructions), but you need <B>wget</B> version 1.9.1
or higher.</P>
<P>Get XMLTV from 
<A HREF="http://wiki.xmltv.org/index.php/Main_Page">http://wiki.xmltv.org/index.php/Main_Page</A>.  Download the latest version (0.5.57).</P>

<P>Schedules Direct is a non-profit organization which has licensed
Television program data from Tribune Media Services and makes it

</H2>

<P>If you are going to use <B>subversion</B>, execute the following
instructions to obtain the latest trunk version of MythTV:</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
$ mkdir mythtv
$ svn co http://svn.mythtv.org/svn/trunk/ mythtv
$ cd mythtv
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>To use a release version, you can execute:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
$ mkdir mythtv-release-0.22-fixes
$ svn co http://svn.mythtv.org/svn/branches/release-0-22-fixes/ mythtv-release-0.22-fixes
$ cd mythtv-release-0.22-fixes
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P><B>NOTE</B>:  Using a svn version of the code allows you to stay
up-to-date with changes.  So, if there's an update to the 0.22 release and
you originally obtained it using svn, you could enter the
mythtv-release-0.22-fixes directory and type "svn up", which will update your copy
with the fixed version from the website.  You would then recompile and
install the updated 0.22 code.</P>
<P>If you are using the tarball, then unpack it:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
$ tar -xjf mythtv-0.22.tar.bz2
$ cd mythtv-0.22
$ ./configure
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>If you wish to change options, run <B>./configure --help</B> to
see what is available and to override and automatically detected options.
See the <CODE>config.log</CODE> file after running <B>configure</B> to see
previous runs.</P>
<P>To compile:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
$ make -j 2
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>The MythTV compile can take advantage of multiple CPUs, SMP and
Hyperthreading.  If you want to build MythTV on a multi-CPU machine (or with
<B>distcc</B>), specify "-j numjobs", where "numjobs" is greater than 2.
In the above example, we had two concurrent jobs executing, which is
recommended for a single CPU system.  Do not set the number of jobs too
high, or your compile will actually take longer to complete than it would if
you did a "normal" build.</P>
<P>If you are using <B>distcc</B>, and you had two other host machines (red, blue)
participating, you would do something like:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
$ export DISTCC_HOSTS='localhost red blue'
$ make -j 6 CXX=distcc
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>The actual speed-up, if any, is dependant on a number of factors, such as
number of CPUs / hosts, etc.  The <B>distcc</B> documentation recommends
using a <CODE>-j</CODE> value of twice the number of CPUs available to keep all
of them busy.</P>
<P>Some timing information.  The following should only be used for
illustration; your actual results may vary.  The test involves a complete
<CODE>make distclean</CODE> to the final binary.
<UL>
<LI>P4 3.2Ghz HT: "standard" make: 12m 49s</LI>
<LI>P4 3.2Ghz HT: make -j 2: 11m 24s</LI>
</UL>
</P>
<P>In the above example, we see that with a single CPU, a multi-stage
<B>make</B> does not significantly decrease compile time.</P>
<P>Once the compile is done, switch to superuser:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
$ su
# make install
# exit
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>

<H3>Enabling real-time scheduling of the display thread.</H3>

<P>MythTV supports real-time scheduling of the video output thread. There
are three ways to go about enabling this: You can use rlimits, you can use
the realtime security module, or on older systems you can SUID the
executable. Enabling real-time scheduling is optional, but can make the
video display smoother, especially if you are decoding HDTV.</P>

<H3>rlimits</H3>

<P>The rlimits method is the preferred method and is included in Linux
2.6.12 and above. Unfortunately, you need PAM version 0.79 or above, which
may not be supported by your distribution yet. Assuming anyone running
<B>mythfrontend</B> is in the audio group and rlimits are supported, all
you need to do is place this in your <CODE>/etc/security/limits.conf</CODE></P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
*               -       rtprio     0
*               -       nice       0
@audio          -       rtprio     50
@audio          -       nice       0
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>

<H3>realtime module</H3>

<P>The second option is to use the Linux realtime kernel module.
This is will be phased out over time, but is currently supported
by many distributions that do not yet support rlimits. If you are
not using the distribution kernel you must configure your kernel
with:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
Security options : [*] Enable different security models
Security options : [M] Default Linux Capabilties
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

You may also need to install the realtime module, using your distribution's
realtime package. Assuming the users who will be running
<B>mythfrontend</B> will be in the audio group you can get the GUID of a named
group like so:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
$ grep audio /etc/group
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

If the number printed out from the grep was 18, you can now load
this module as root before starting <B>mythfrontend</B>:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
# modprobe realtime gid=18
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>

<H3>run as root option (not safe)</H3>

<P>The final and least preferred option is to set the sticky bit
on the <B>mythfrontend</B> executable. This <B>opens a security hole</B>,
but is the only option on systems that do not support either
rlimits or the realtime module. This does not work on modern
distributions either, and is <B><EM>not recommended</EM></B>
on any system connected to the Internet. This may also make it
impossible to debug MythTV without running <B>gdb</B> as root. If you
would still like to do this, you just need to run this as root:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
# chmod a+s /usr/local/bin/mythfrontend /usr/local/bin/mythtv
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>

<H3><A NAME="frontend-only"></A> Frontend-only configuration </H3>

<P>Since MythTV uses a client/server architecture, multiple frontend
computers can simultaneously access content on a Myth system.  Live TV,
watching and scheduling recordings, etc. are all possible from multiple
frontends.</P>
<P>To get a better picture of what is needed to run a frontend, note the
following:
<LI>You do NOT need the MySQL server installed on your remote frontend</LI>
<LI>You do NOT need XMLTV installed on your remote frontend</LI>
<LI>You do NOT need to run the mythtv-setup program on
your frontend machine</LI>
</P>
<P>Other than the exclusion of the MySQL server and XMLTV, the MythTV
compilation procedure is the same as when you're setting up both a backend
and a frontend.  However, you <EM>will</EM> need to install the database
access libraries.</P>
<P>Once MythTV is compiled and installed:
<LI>Run the mythtv-setup program on your Master backend. Under the "General"
menu, change the IP address of the current machine (by default, "127.0.0.1")
to the real external IP address - 127.0.0.1 is the loopback address and no
external machine can access it. Change the Master Server IP setting to the
same IP address as well.</LI>
<LI>Run the mythfrontend program on your frontend machine,
and a "Database Configuration" screen should appear.
Set the "Host name" field to point to your Master backend's IP address.</LI>

</H2>

<P>Installation of MythTV on Gentoo consists of simply emerging the desired
ebuild because all of the packages are now part of the official Portage tree.
