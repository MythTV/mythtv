<P>MythTV does not have native remote control receiver and decoder software
built-in.  Instead, remote control functions are implemented by cooperating
with <B>lirc</B>, the Linux Infrared Remote Control program.  <B>lirc</B>
handles the IR hardware and passes keystrokes to MythTV, which then acts as
if the user had pressed the keys on the keyboard.  The file
<CODE>keys.txt</CODE> describes the keys used to control MythTV.</P>

You're going to need to know what sort of receiver you have and where it's
connected.  In the case of the Pinnacle Studio TV card, with the IR receiver
connected to COM1 (/dev/ttys0), once the configuration menu comes up,
perform the configuration by going to Driver Configuration->Other Serial
Port Devices->Pinnacle Systems Receiver->OK and on the next page select
COM1->OK.</P>
<P>Each remote is different; some remote receivers connect directly to your
capture card and not to a serial port, so make sure that you've got the
correct one.</P>
<P>You then click "Save Configuration and run configure" to continue.</P>
<P>Make sure you read the last text generated by the configure step. It will
tell you if you require a kernel recompile, and what the name of your kernel
module will be (if necessary). For instance a home-built receiver may
require a kernel recompile, so you would be notified that you will have to
load the lirc_serial module. If you did not get any such messages skip the
kernel recompile steps below and go directly to making and installing the
lirc driver.</P>
<P>Once the configuration step is complete:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
$ make
$ su
# make install
# chmod 666 /dev/lircd
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>At this point, if you're using a serial receiver, check that there's a
<CODE>lirc</CODE> device in <CODE>/dev</CODE>:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
$ ls -l /dev/li*
lr-xr-xr-x    1 root     root            5 Jan 27 09:00 /dev/lirc -> ttyS0

</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>As you can see, there's a link from /dev/lirc to ttyS0, a.k.a. "COM1", which is
appropriate for the Pinnacle Systems PCTV Pro.  However, you may notice
something like this:

Some IR receivers (including some homebrew units) use a character device as
their data interface as opposed to a link to a serial port.  If the <CODE>make
install</CODE> step has created a character device for you, don't replace it
with a link to a COM port.</P>
<P>So, if the link or character device was not created (but should have been),
ensure that you ran the <CODE>make install</CODE> step as root.  If it still
doesn't work, then there are three options.  The first option is to re-read
the <B>lirc</B> documentation to determine whether your IR receiver is a
character device or should be a link to a serial port and to create the
link/character device manually.  In this example, the IR device is connected
to ttyS0.  If it were connected to "COM2", then use ttyS1, etc.

<CAPTION><B>NOTE</B>:  The above example assumes that your receiver uses the

<P>See the lirc documentation for additional information.  The lirc

<P>The second option is to post your issue to the <EM>lirc</EM> list, not the
mythtv-users list.  The lirc programmers will be the ones that can assist
you best.</P>
<P>The third option is to dispense with lirc altogether by purchasing an IR
keyboard (various options exist, although Chicony appears to work for some
people) and a learning remote control.  The IR keyboard receiver plugs into
the PS/2 keyboard port on your PC and you would train your learning remote
to emulate the various keystrokes from <CODE>keys.txt</CODE> of your IR
keyboard.  Using this method removes lirc entirely from the picture - your
remote will be sending keypresses that your PC "sees" on the keyboard port.</P>

<P>Follow the on-screen directions to train your remote and define keys. If  
your remote ends up working well, you should consider submitting your

<P>This takes care of the lircd portion, which "listens" for the IR signals. If

if you've got a Pinnacle Studio PCTV remote.

$ irw

</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

Start pressing the keys on your remote; <B>irw</B> will
print the name of the button as it is defined in your
<CODE>/etc/lircd.conf</CODE>. If you don't see anything at this point, you need
to troubleshoot further by going back to the lirc home page and investigating
from there.</P>
<P>If it is working, then press <B>CTRL-C</B> to abort the program.  Once you
know that your remote is working, you can either recompile MythTV with
native lirc support by enabling it in <B>configure</B> or you
need to run the <B>irxevent</B> program, which takes the key presses and
sends them to MythTV.  If you use native lirc support, you don't need to run
<B>irxevent</B>.  If you are going to use irxevent, then you need to run
it like this:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
$ irxevent &amp;

If <B>irxevent</B> isn't running, then MythTV will not respond to your remote

<H2><A NAME="ss8.6">8.6</A> <A HREF="mythtv-HOWTO.html#toc8.6">Additional information for lirc</A>
</H2>

<P>Take a look at the lircrc.example files in the <CODE>configfiles/</CODE>
directory.  In my case, (Pinnacle Studio card) the channel up and down functions
weren't working, due to the fact that the button names were different than
the default <CODE>lircrc.example</CODE> file that came with MythTV.</P>
<P>The <CODE>lircrc.example</CODE> file has this:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
begin
    prog = irxevent
    button = ChannelUp
    config = Key Up CurrentWindow
end

begin
    prog = irxevent
    button = ChannelDown
    config = Key Down CurrentWindow
end
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

but the <CODE>/etc/lircd.conf</CODE> that comes in the lircd package 
defines the buttons for the Pinnacle Studio PCTV as:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
          channel+                 0x0000000000000017
          channel-                 0x000000000000001C
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

rather than "ChannelUp" and "ChannelDown".  I added the 
following to my /home/[yourusername]/.lircrc file:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
begin
    prog = irxevent
    button = channel+
    repeat = 3
    config = Key Up CurrentWindow
end

begin
    prog = irxevent
    button = channel-
    repeat = 3
    config = Key Down CurrentWindow
end
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

which took care of basic functionality.  Because the PCTV Studio remote
has additional buttons, look at the
<CODE>configfiles/lircrc.example.pinnaclestudiopctv</CODE> for an example of how
to define additional buttons, and how to debug potential button name
conflicts between the <CODE>lircrc.example</CODE> file and how <B>your</B>
remote defines the button names.</P>
<P>By examining the button names defined in <CODE>/etc/lircd.conf</CODE> and using
the <B>irw</B> program to make sure that your remote is working, you can
create the appropriate mappings in <CODE>.lircrc</CODE> to get excellent remote
functionality with MythTV.</P>
<P>Note the <B>repeat =</B> parameter.  This informs the <CODE>irxevent</CODE>
program to pass through every third keypress.  By default, <CODE>lirc</CODE>
will only send one keypress to the application, even if you're holding down
the key.  The actual <B>repeat =</B> number will vary from system to
system, so experiment and see which value works best for you.</P>

<P>Lirc has support for various IR transmitters. A popular model is the Actisys
IR-200L 
<A HREF="http://store.snapstreamstore.com/accessories.html">http://store.snapstreamstore.com/accessories.html</A>. It was
originally designed for IRDA communication, but can be used to transmit A/V remote
control codes. By using the lirc SIR driver, this device can easily be
integrated with MythTV. I have tested this device with an AT&amp;T DCT2000
digital cable box but the instructions can be used to configure other IRDA
devices and A/V remotes.</P>
<P>Follow the steps in the previous section.  When you run setup.sh, select
option 1, driver configuration. From here select option 6, IrDA hardware.
Select your appropriate device and the corresponding serial port, then Save
configuration &amp; run configure from the main menu. Once configure is done
type:

<P>Please note: unlike the Pinnacle receiver above you will be compiling lircd
in addition to a kernel module for the SIR transmitter. Depending on whether
you have your serial port driver configured as a kernel module you might see
the following message during make:

Below is a copy of the script followed by the corresponding perl script.
Make sure both are in your path. Also make sure you leave the #!/bin/csh
