<P>Before you compile MythTV from the current source tarball or from
<B>subversion</B>, you may need to modify your system configuration in a
few ways.</P>
<P>In general, if you install MythTV from pre-packaged binaries for your Linux
distribution/version, you don't need to be too concerned about the issues in
this section of the HOWTO - the install script for the packages should take
care of them. However, this section is still recommended reading which may
help if the packager skipped a step in their packaging.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss4.1">4.1</A> <A HREF="mythtv-HOWTO.html#toc4.1">Software requirements for compiling MythTV</A>
</H2>

<H3>General requirements</H3>

<P>MythTV is written in C++ and requires a fairly complete, but standard, 
compilation environment, including a recent g++ compiler, <CODE>make</CODE>, and 
appropriate headers files for shared libraries. Any standard Linux 
distribution should be able to install a suitable compilation environment 
from its packaging system. Section 3.2 of this HOWTO provides some details 
of how to install the required environment for many distributions.</P>
<P>Subsequent sections of this chapter address the few oddities that you may 
have to adjust by hand before you compile MythTV.</P>
<P>The reference compilation system for MythTV is Ubuntu.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss4.2">4.2</A> <A HREF="mythtv-HOWTO.html#toc4.2">Shared-Library requirements for MythTV </A>
</H2>

<H3><A NAME="modifying_ld.so.conf"></A> Modifying /etc/ld.so.conf </H3>

<P>The runtime manager for shared libraries, <B>/lib/ld.so</B>, gets
information about the locations and contents of shared libraries from
<CODE>/etc/ld.so.cache</CODE>, a file created by <B>ldconfig</B> from
information in <CODE>/etc/ld.so.conf</CODE>.  Because MythTV installs some
shared libraries in <CODE>/usr/local/lib</CODE>, that directory needs to be
added to the list of directories for <B>ld.so</B> to search when doing
runtime linking of programs, if it is not already there.
You do this, as root, by editing <CODE>/etc/ld.so.conf</CODE>, then
running <B>ldconfig</B>. There are many ways to do this; one that
works is to enter this series of commands:</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
$ su -
# echo /usr/local/lib >> /etc/ld.so.conf
# /sbin/ldconfig
# exit
$
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<H2><A NAME="ss4.3">4.3</A> <A HREF="mythtv-HOWTO.html#toc4.3">Environment variable requirements for MythTV</A>
</H2>

<H3>General requirements</H3>

<H3>QT libraries and binaries</H3>

<P>The compiler needs to be able to locate QT binaries and libraries in
order to compile MythTV. QTDIR needs to be set and the directory holding the
QT binaries needs to be added to your PATH.  Your distribution may already
be making these changes as a part of the installation of the software
prerequisites detailed earlier.</P>
<P>One way to do this is as follows: 
<A NAME="Checking_that_it_worked"></A> </P>
<P>Open a shell and execute the following:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
$ echo $PATH
/usr/local/bin:/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/X11R6/bin:/usr/games:/usr/lib/qt3/bin:/home/mythtv/bin:/usr/lib/qt3/bin
$ echo $QTDIR
/usr/lib/qt3
$ which qmake
/usr/lib/qt3/bin/qmake
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>For Mandriva, you should see a value like <CODE>/usr/lib/qt3</CODE> for
<CODE>QTDIR</CODE> and <CODE>/usr/lib/qt3/bin</CODE> should be in $PATH.</P>
<P>For Gentoo, you should see a value like <CODE>/usr/qt/3</CODE> for <CODE>QTDIR</CODE> 
and <CODE>/usr/qt/3/bin</CODE> should be in $PATH.</P>
<P>If you don't, do not proceed past this step until you have resolved this
error. You may need to manually specify the QTDIR and PATH at the shell
prompt before compiling.</P>
<P>Also, check that there has been a link created in
<CODE>/usr/lib/qt3/mkspecs</CODE> (<CODE>/usr/share/qt3/mkspecs</CODE> for Debian)
called <CODE>default</CODE>. If not, you'll get errors during the compile. See
the Troubleshooting Section for more information.</P>
<H3>Distribution-Specific Notes</H3>

<H3>Mandriva</H3>

<P>The following instructions work for Mandriva using
<B>bash</B> as the shell, and may be applicable for a distribution which
uses <CODE>/etc/profile.d</CODE>.</P>
<P>
<FIGURE>
<EPS FILE="stop.eps">
<IMG SRC="stop.png">
<CAPTION><B>NOTE</B>:  Mandriva 10 installs a <CODE>/etc/profile.d/qtdir3.sh</CODE>
file, but it doesn't include the addition of the PATH variable.  If you're
running Mandriva 10, don't create a <CODE>mythtv.sh</CODE> file as detailed
below; edit the <CODE>qtdir3.sh</CODE> file and add the PATH statement within
the if / fi block.</CAPTION>
</FIGURE>

As root, create the following file in <CODE>/etc/profile.d</CODE> The example
filename is "mythtv.sh". Use what you feel is appropriate.</P>
<P>Open a shell, and switch to superuser mode. </P>
<P>
<FIGURE>
<EPS FILE="warning.eps">
<IMG SRC="warning.png">
<CAPTION><B>NOTE</B>: ^D means press CTRL and d at the same time.</CAPTION>
</FIGURE>

<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
$ su
# cd /etc/profile.d
cat > mythtv.sh
export QTDIR=/usr/lib/qt3
export PATH=$PATH:/usr/lib/qt3/bin
^D

# chmod a+x mythtv.sh
# exit
$ exit
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

The last two commands are to exit out of the shell. This way, when you next 
open a shell your new commands
will take effect.</P>
<H3>Red Hat Linux 9</H3>

<P><B>NOTE</B>: This section will be considered abandoned as of v0.20.</P>
<P>Red Hat Linux 9 use a default locale with UTF-8 encoding.
Date::Manip, a perl module used by XMLTV, is not UTF-8 safe. As a result,
whenever you run mythtv-setup or mythfilldatabase you will get a lot of 
UTF-8 warnings. There is an 
<A HREF="http://membled.com/work/patches/DateManip/">http://membled.com/work/patches/DateManip/</A> updated version of
Date::Manip at the XMLTV site fixing this and other XMLTV related
bugs.</P>

<H3><A NAME="devperms"></A> Device Permissions </H3>

<P>MythTV will need access to the video4linux devices on your system.  By
default, your distribution may restrict access to these devices to the
logged-in user, so if you will be automatically starting
<B>mythbackend</B> from a script rather than an interactive terminal
session you will need to make some adjustments.</P>
<P><B>NOTE</B>: The following instructions are accurate for Mandriva.</P>
<P>Check for a file called <CODE>/etc/security/console.perms</CODE>.  Open the file
in your favorite text editor and look for a line that has:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
&lt;console>  0600 &lt;v4l>        0600 root.video
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

and replace it with
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
&lt;console>  0666 &lt;v4l>        0666 root.video
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>What we're doing is allowing read and write access to the files in the
video4linux directory.</P>
