/**
\mainpage %MythTV Architecture

\section intro Introduction

Over the last couple years %MythTV has grown into a rather large
application. The purpose of these pages is to provide a portal
into the code for developers to get their heads around it.
This is intended for both those new to %MythTV and experienced
with it to get familiar with different aspects of the code base.

If you are just looking for the code formatting standards,
see the official %MythTV wiki article
<a href="http://www.mythtv.org/wiki/Coding_Standards">
coding standards</a>. If you are looking for the
<a href="http://code.mythtv.org/trac/wiki/TicketHowTo">bug tracker</a>,
it can be found on the official pages.
If you haven't already, you should subscribe to
the <a href="http://www.mythtv.org/mailman/listinfo/mythtv-dev/">
developer mailing list</a> and the <a href="http://www.mythtv.org/mailman/listinfo/mythtv-commits/">Commits mailing list</a>

If you just stumbled onto the developer pages
by accident, maybe you want to go to the official
<a href="http://www.mythtv.org/docs/">%MythTV
 User Documentation</a> or <a href="http://wiki.mythtv.org/">%MythTV
 Wiki</a>.

If you are new to Qt programming it is essential that you keep in mind
that almost all Qt objects are not thread-safe, including QString.
The Qt containers QMap, QSet, QHash, QString, QList, etc are
copy-on-write containers. This means that when you assign one
container from another the data isn't actually copied. Instead
a copy of a pointer to the data is made and the reference count
is increased. Then when you actually modify the date or get 
a modifiable reference into the container an actual copy is
made. This means you can return one of these containers efficiently
from a function without needing C++11 support. This also means
these containers are a bit less efficient than their STL equivalents
most of the time. We still prefer them in %MythTV code, especially
QString due to the extensive i18n support in Qt. QList is actually
equivalent to an STL deque. We also use the STL style iterators. This
is both because it makes it easier to switch to an STL container in
the rare case when it is necessary, such as when we need a reverse
iterator iterator, and because they are more efficient than the
Java style iterators that Qt also supports.

In Qt 3.x and Qt 4.0 assignment of one Qt copy-on-write was
not yet thread-safe. Because of this you will see a number of
\::detach() calls in %MythTV code. These calls force a deep copy
to be made immediately and should either be removed or a comment
should be added in the rare case where this is done as an
optimization and not just a hold-over from when copy-on-write 
wasn't yet thread-safe in Qt 4.0 and earlier.

There are some special dangers when
\ref qobject_dangers "using QObject" outside the Qt event thread.

There is a short HOWTO on \ref profiling_mythtv available in addition
to documentation on the code itself.

There are also a few simple \ref testing "testing shortcuts".

\section libs Libraries

%MythTV is divided up into over 20 libraries:
<dl>
  <dt>\ref libmythbase "libmythbase"
      <dd>Lowest-level %MythTV library. Used by the Plugins.

      Contains the \ref database_subsystem "database",
      and network support code (used by the
      \ref myth_network_protocol "MythTV network protocol" and
      \ref lcd_subsystem "LCDproc interface").

      This also contains some other basic functionality and classes
      which are used by one or more of \ref libmyth "libmyth", \ref
      libmythui "libmythui" and \ref libmythtv "libmythtv".

      Any changes to this library's ABI may trigger a %MythTV binary version
      change because the plugins depend on it.

  <dt>\ref libmythui "libmythui"
      <dd>Main user interface rendering library. Used by the Plugins.

      The mouse/touchscreen gesture, remote control
      (\ref lirc_subsystem "LIRC" and AppleRemote)
      and screen saver control code are also contained in this library.

      This library depends on \ref libmyth "libmyth". Any changes to
      this library's ABI may trigger a %MythTV binary version change
      because the plugins depend on it.

  <dt>\ref libmythupnp "libmythupnp"
      <dd>Simple uPnP (universal Plug and Play) support.

      This library depends on \ref libmythbase "libmythbase".

  <dt>\ref libmyth "libmyth"
      <dd>Core %MythTV library. Used by the Plugins.
      The
      \ref audio_subsystem "audio",
      \ref lang_supp language support,
      \ref plugin_arch "plugin manager",
      \ref myth_media "media manager",
      and some old UI widgets are implemented by libmyth.

      This library depends on libav*, \ref libmythbase "libmythbase",
      \ref libmythui "libmythui", \ref libmythupnp "libmythupnp",
      libsamplerate, libmythsoundtouch and libmythfreesurround.

      Any changes to this library's ABI may trigger a %MythTV binary version
      change because the plugins depend on it.

  <dt>\ref libmythtv "libmythtv"
      <dd>%MythTV %TV functionality library. Used by some Plugins.
      The
      \ref osd_subsystem "OSD",
      \ref recorder_subsystem "recorders", \ref video_subsystem "video" and
      \ref av_player_subsystem "A/V players" are implemented by libmythtv.

      This library basically depends on all the other libraries!

      This library is used by some plugins so changes to it's ABI may
      require a %MythTV binary version change.

      Any changes to classes that are serialized by the
      \ref myth_network_protocol "MythTV network protocol" (for example
      ProgramInfo) or to the protocol itself require the protocol version
      number to be incremented.

  <dt>libavcodec/libavformat/libavutil/libpostproc/libswscale
      <dd>These together form the FFmpeg A/V decoding library (aka avlib).
      <a href="http://ffmpeg.mplayerhq.hu/documentation.html">
          Documented Externally</a>.

      These should be modified as little as possible, and any changes
      should be sent upstream for inclusion in the FFmpeg project's
      version of these libraries.

      These libraries do not depend on any of our libraries.

  <dt>libmythmpeg2
      <dd>Alternate MPEG-1/2 A/V decoding library.
      <a href="http://libmpeg2.sourceforge.net/">Documented externally</a>.
      This is offered as
      an option for software decoding of MPEG-1 and MPEG-2 files.
      FFmpeg is still used for decoding MPEG still frames when this
      library is selected for playback.

      This library does not depend on any of our libraries.

  <dt>libsamplerate
      <dd>Audio resampling library.
      <a href="http://www.mega-nerd.com/SRC/api.html">Documented Externally</a>.
      We use this to support different output sample rates than the sample
      rate used in the audio streams we play.

      This library does not depend on any of our libraries.

  <dt>libmythsoundtouch
      <dd>Pitch preserving audio resampling library.
      <a href="http://www.surina.net/soundtouch/">External Website</a>.
      We use this for the time-stretch feature.

      This library does not depend on any of our libraries.

  <dt>libmythbluray/libmythdvdnav
      <dd>Used for navigating Blu Ray and DVD menus
      when using the internal player.

      This library should not depend on any of our libraries.

  <dt>libmythfreemheg
      <dd>UK interactive %TV viewer.

      This library does not depend on any of our libraries.

  <dt>libmythfreesurround
      <dd>Support for some multi-channel audio transforms.

      This library does not depend on any of our libraries.

  <dt>libmythnvctrl
      <dd>Interface between X-windows and NVidia drivers.

      This library does not depend on any of our libraries.

  <dt>libhdhomerun
      <dd>Interface to the SiliconDust HDHomeRun EtherNet connected TV tuner
      products.

      <a href="http://www.silicondust.com/hdhomerun/hdhomerun_development.pdf">
      Documented externally</a>.

      This library does not depend on any of our libraries.

</dl>
Two libraries libmythmpeg2 and libsamplerate appear redundant, but
libmpeg2 decodes MPEG-2 more quickly than ffmpeg on some systems, and
libsamplerate resamples audio with better quality when we only need
to match the hardware sample rate to the A/V streams audio sample rate.

\section db Database Schema
The database schema is documented \ref db_schema "here".

\section apps Applications
%MythTV contains 13 applications which are installed by make install

<dl>
  <dt>mythbackend      <dd>This is the backend server which runs the recorders.
                           On frontend only systems, the binary needs to be
                           installed to perform some functions for the
                           frontend, but does not need to be constantly
                           running -- the frontend will run it as needed.
  <dt>mythfrontend
      <dd>This is the frontend which is the main application
          for viewing programs and using the %MythTV plugins.
  <dt>mythtv-setup     <dd>This is the program which sets up the database
                           to use a machine as a backend server.
  <dt>mythavtest
      <dd>For testing audio and video playback. Was once an "External Player"
          used to play video files from within mythfrontend. %Setting the
          player command to "internal" achieves the same thing now.
  <dt>mythtvosd
      <dd>This is used externally by programs that want to pop-up an
          <i>on screen display</i> in %MythTV while one is watching a recording.
  <dt>mythfilldatabase
      <dd>This is used both internally and externally to fetch program listings.
          <a href="http://tms.tribune.com/">Tribune Media</a> provides
          listings in exchange for demographic information in the USA,
          and Australia has a
          <a href="http://minnie.tuhs.org/twiki/bin/view/TVGuide">
          community-driven TV guide</a> originally developed for OzTiVo.
          Other markets are served by the
          <a href="http://membled.com/work/apps/xmltv/xmltv">XMLTV</a>
          web spiders.
  <dt>mythtranscode    <dd>This is used both internally and externally to
                           transcode videos from one format to another.
                           This is used to shrink HDTV programs to lower
                           quality recordings that match the hardware the
                           user has.
  <dt>mythjobqueue     <dd>This can be run on a frontend only system instead
                           of mythbackend to handle commercial flagging,
                           transcode and user jobs. The only advantage over
                           running a full mythbackend is to use sligtly less
                           memory.
  <dt>mythcommflag     <dd>This is used internally by mythfrontend to flag
                           commercials. It can also be used to repair keyframe
                           maps for recordings.
  <dt>mythlcdserver    <dd>This is an interface between a number of %Myth
                           clients and a small text display (LCDProc server).
  <dt>mythwelcome/mythshutdown
      <dd>These programs manage Power Saving (shutdown/wakeup) on your %MythTV
          PCs.
  <dt>mythlogserver
      <dd>A tool that records log messages from a number of other myth
          applications in one stream, storing them in any or all of;
          a logfile, the Unix system log (if availale), and the MySQL database.

/** \defgroup database_subsystem    Database Subsystem
    \todo No one is working on documenting the database subsystem.

There are a few classes that deal directly with the database:
MythContext, MSqlDatabase, DBStorage, MDBManager, SimpleDBStorage.

MythTV's Configurable widgets also do save and restore their values
from the database automagically when used in %MythTV's window classes.
 */

/** \defgroup recorder_subsystem    Recorder Subsystem

\ingroup libmythtv

TVRec is the main class for handling recording.
It is passed a ProgramInfo for the current and next recordings,
and in turn creates three main worker classes:
<dl>
  <dt>RecorderBase <dd>Recordings from device into RingBuffer.
  <dt>ChannelBase  <dd>Changes the channel and other recording device attributes. Optional.
  <dt>RingBuffer   <dd>Handles A/V file I/O, including streaming.
</dl>

%TVRec also presents the public face of a recordings to the
\ref myth_network_protocol, and hence the rest of %MythTV. This
means that any call to the %RecorderBase, %RingBuffer, or
%ChannelBase is marshalled via methods in the %TVRec.

RecorderBase contains classes for recording %MythTV's
specialized Nuppel Video files, as well as classes for
handling various hardware encoding devices such as MPEG2,
HDTV, DVB and Firewire recorders.
ChannelBase meanwhile only contains three subclasses, %Channel
for handling v4l and v4l2 devices, and %DVBChannel and
%FirewireChannel, for handling DVB and Firewire respectively.
Other channel changing hardware use ChannelBase's external
channel changing program support.
Finally, RingBuffer does all reading and writing of A/V files
for both TV (playback) and %TVRec, including streaming
over network connections to the frontend's %RingBuffer.

%TVRec has four active states, the first three of which
correspond to the same states in %TV: kState_WatchingLiveTV,
kState_WatchingPreRecorded, kState_WatchingRecording, and
kState_RecordingOnly.
When watching "Live TV" the recorder records whatever the
frontend requests and streams it out using the %RingBuffer,
this may be to disk or over the network.
When watching pre-recorded programs %TVRec simply streams a
file on disk out using the %RingBuffer.
When just watching a recording, %TVRec continues a recording
started as recording-only while simultaneously streaming out
using the %RingBuffer.
Finally, when in the recording-only mode the recording
is only saved to disk using %RingBuffer and no streaming
to the frontend is performed.

%TVRec also has three additional states: kState_Error,
kState_None, kState_ChangingState. The error state allows
%MythTV to know when something has gone wrong. The null or
none state means the recorder is not doing anything and
is ready for commands. Finally, the "ChangingState" state
tells us that a state change request is pending, so other
state changing commands should not be issued.

\todo Check if the TVRec is actually still passed a ProgramInfo for the current and next recordings

\todo Document the massive changes Daniel has made in the Vid and MultiRec branches
 */

/** \defgroup av_player_subsystem   A/V Player Subsystem

\ingroup libmythtv

TV is the main class for handling playback.
It instantiates several important classes:
<dl>
<dt>NuppelVideoPlayer <dd>Decodes audio and video from the RingBuffer, then plays and displays them, resp.
<dt>RemoteEncoder     <dd>Communicates with TVRec on the backend.
<dt>OSD               <dd>Creates on-screen-display for NuppelVideoPlayer to display.
<dt>RingBuffer        <dd>Handles A/V file I/O, including streaming.
</dl>

NuppelVideoPlayer is a bit of a misnomer. This class plays all video formats
that %MythTV can handle. It creates AudioOutput to handle the audio, a FilterChain
to perform post-processing on the video, a DecoderBase class to do the actual
video decoding, and a VideoOutput class to do the actual video output. See
that class for more on what it does.

%TV has three active states that correspond to the same states in TVRec:
kState_WatchingLiveTV, kState_WatchingPreRecorded, kState_WatchingRecording.
When watching "LiveTV" the %TVRec via RemoteEncoder responds to channel
changing and other commands from %TV while streaming the recording to
%TV's %RingBuffer.
When watching a pre-recorded stream, a recording is streamed from TVRec's
%RingBuffer to %TV's %RingBuffer, but no channel changing commands can be
sent to TVRec.
When watching an 'in-progress' recording things work pretty much as when
watching a pre-recorded stream, except %TV must be prevented from seeking
too far ahead in the program, and keyframe and commercial flags must be
synced from the recorder periodically.

%TV also has three additional states: kState_Error,
kState_None, kState_ChangingState. The error state allows
%MythTV to know when something has gone wrong. The null or
none state means the player is not doing anything and
is ready for commands. Finally, the "ChangingState" state
tells us that a state change request is pending, so other
state changing commands should not be issued.

MythPlugins are shared object files (_i.e._libraries) which are loaded
from a specific directory (_%e.g._ /usr/local/lib/mythtv/plugins).
Currently, all plugins are written in the C++ language, but there is nothing
preventing other languages being used (the functions are in the C name space).
c
int mythplugin_init(const char *libversion); is invoked whenever mythfrontend
is started. This typically handles upgrading any database records - it will be
the first method called after a new version of the plugin has been installed.

int mythplugin_run(); is invoked when the action attribute of a menu item
requests it via the PLUGIN directive. This is when the user chooses to enter
the plugin from the main menu or the appropriate submenu.

int mythplugin_config(); is invoked when the action attribute of a menu item
requests it via the CONFIGPLUGIN directive. This should be when the users
wishes to change the plugin's settings (in the main Setup menu).

Other plugin functions are listed in the file \link mythpluginapi.h \endlink
(see also the \link MythPlugin \endlink
 and \link MythPluginManager \endlink classes.)

*/

/** \defgroup myth_media            MythTV Media Manager

\ingroup libmyth

The %MythTV Media Manager is a thread in the frontend which looks for any
changes to removable media, and sends events to any Frontend Plugins
which are interested in that media.

At startup, it creates a list of MythMediaDevice objects (currently
MythHDD or MythCDROM and its subclasses) for each removable device
configured on the system. A runtime loop then monitors each of these
via its checkMedia() method.

When any of these devices change status, a MediaEvent object is created.
If the device has a status which is usable, the window jumps to the main menu
(to allow the registered jump to work correctly), and the event is dispatched
to the relevant plugin's registered media handler. If the device status is
unusable (<I>%e.g.</I> ejected), the plugin's media handler is called directly
(so it can "forget" about this device).

The following tables show
typical status transitions for CD/DVD and USB flash drive devices:

\verbatim
      CD/DVD                     USB/FireWire HDD

/** \defgroup myth_network_protocol MythTV Network Protocol

The %MythTV backend process currently opens sockets for three different types
of commands; a custom protocol (by default at port 6543),
an HTML server (by default <A HREF="http://127.0.0.1:6544/Status">
http://127.0.0.1:6544/Status
</A> for the status, and other services under that, like
< HREF="http://127.0.0.1:6544/Myth/GetMusic?Id=1">
http://127.0.0.1:6544/Myth/GetMusic?Id=1
</A>), and a UPnP media server (several ports that I cannot
remember right now that throw around lots of little bits of XML :-)

The custom protocol is an ASCII encoded length and command string.
Command sequences can be easily sent to the backend using telnet.
<I>%e.g.</I> \verbatim telnet 127.0.0.1 6543
Trying 127.0.0.1...
Connected to localhost.
Escape character is '^]'.\endverbatim
<B>\verbatim21      MYTH_PROTO_VERSION 44 23     ANN Playback hostname 1   10   QUERY_LOAD       4DONE\endverbatim</B>
\verbatim13      ACCEPT[]:[]442       OK34      0.919922[]:[]0.908203[]:[]0.856445Connection closed by foreign host.\endverbatim
The command string is prefixed by 8 characters, containing the length
of the forthcoming command. This can be justified in any way
(as the above example shows)

The backend responds with a length, and the response to the command.
This can be numbers (up to 32 bit, represented in ASCII),
a single string, or an ASCII encoding of a QStringList.
The 5 byte sequence "[]:[]" separates items in the stringlist.
Any 64 bit numbers are represented as a stringlist of two 32bit words
(MSB first).

\section commands Commands

There are three main types of networking interactions in %MythTV;
identification commands (which tell the backend about this client),
query commands that are sent to the master backend
(<I>%e.g.</I> listing recordings or viewing guide data), and
file streaming commands (when a frontend is watching or editing a recording).

Until a client is identified to the backend (via the ANN commands),
any of the query or file streaming commands will silently fail.

The following summarises some of these commands.
For a full understanding of all the commands, either read the source code
(programs/mythbackend/mainserver.cpp), or look on the Wiki
(http://www.mythtv.org/wiki/Category:Myth_Protocol_Commands).

 */

/** \defgroup myth_startup MythTV Startup Sequence

Most %MythTV programs follow a common sequence:
<ol>
  <li>Process (parse) command-line arguments</li>
  <li>Create a MythContext object (which contains a MythCoreContext object
      for server and DB communication, logging and some housekeeping)</li>
  <li>(optionally) Create a UPnP client or server</li>
  <li>Initialise the MythContext, which:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Tries to find a database on localhost,
        or on the host specified in config.xml,</li>
    <li>Tries to locate exactly one backend host via UPnP,
        to find its database,</li>
    <li>If possible, displays a list of all backends located via UPnP
        for the user to choose from, or</li>
    <li>Fails</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Create the main window/screen, display themed menus, <i>et c.</i></li>
</ol>
(examine program/{appname}/main.cpp, and libs/libmyth/mythcontext.cpp,
for further detail).

<p>

The "runtime assets" mentioned above are stored in a number of well-known
locations. The following methods in MythContext allow programs and plugins
to access these assets:
<ol>
  <li>GetInstallPrefix() returns either the runtime env. var. $MYTHTVDIR
      or the compile-time var. RUNPREFIX. If these are relative paths,
      it is initialised relative to the application's location.
      The value is used thus:
  <ul>

/**
\defgroup lang_supp MythTV Language Support

There are three sets of language translations in %MythTV;
source code translation, menus, and %MythWeb.

\section lang_src Source Code

The %MythTV C++ graphical programs use the Qt text translation system -
QTranslator - to present messages or button names in the user's local language.
This system uses a number of files that contain the source program's text
strings (in English), and a translation of that string into the language.
Not all languages are supported, and because new messages are regularly added
into the source code, not all of the translation files will be complete -
some messages will still appear in English.

If there is no exact translation for a particular message, the Qt runtime
system attempts to build a translation from existing elements.
The Qt Linguist tool is the recommended way to update the translation files
(which live in mythtv/i18n and mythplugins/{pluginname}/i18n).
If you choose to edit them manually, you must use a UTF compatible editor,
so that the languages which contain accents and multi-byte strings
are not corrupted.

This page:
http://www.mythtv.org/wiki/Translation
on the Wiki explains how to update an existing translation.

To add a new language, look up the ISO 639-1 language code,
name your .qm and .ts files accordingly and add rules for translating
the files in i18n/i18n.pro

\section lang_menu Menus

The XML files that define the menus in %MythTV also
have translations of the menu button labels. See:
\verbatim
mythtv/programs/*/*.xml
mythtv/themes/DVR
mythtv/themes/classic
mythplugins/*/theme/menus/*.xml
\endverbatim
Be sure to edit these with a UTF compatible editor.

\section lang_web MythWeb

%MythWeb also supports translated strings in the web pages it publishes.
See mythplugins/mythweb/modules/_shared/lang/translations.txt for more info.

/** \defgroup qobject_dangers QObject is dangerous for your health

QObject derived classes can be quite useful, they can send and receive
signals, get keyboard events, translate strings into another language
and use QTimers.

But they also can't be \ref qobject_delete "deleted" easily, they
are not \ref qobject_threadsafe "thread-safe", can't participate
as equals in multiple \ref qobject_inheritence "inheritence", can
not be used at all in virtual \ref qobject_inheritence "inheritence".

\section qobject_delete Deleting QObjects

The problem with deleting QObjects has to do with signals, and events.
These can arrive from any thread, and often arrive from the Qt event
thread even if you have not explicitly requested them.

If you have not explicitly connected any signals or slots, and the
only events you might get are dispatched with qApp->postEvent(),
not qApp->sendEvent(), then it is safe to delete the QObject in the
Qt event thread. If your QObject is a GUI object you've passed
given to Qt for it to delete all is good. If your object is only
deleted in response to a posted event or a signal from the Qt event
thread (say from a QTimer()) then you are OK as well.

If your class may be deleted outside a Qt thread, but it does not
explicitly connect any signals or slots, and the only events it
might get are dispatched with qApp->postEvent(), then you can
safely use deleteLater() to queue your object up for deletion
in the event thread.

%MythTV is a very much a multithreaded program so you may need to have
a QObject that may get events from another thread if you send signals
but do not get any signals and or events from outside the Qt event
thread, then you can use deleteLater() or delete depending on whether
you are deleteing the QObject in the event thread, see above. But
if you are not in the Qt event thread then you need to call disconnect()
in the thread that is sending the signals, before calling deleteLater().
This prevents your object from sending events after you consider it
deleted (and begin to delete other QObjects that may still be getting
signals from your object.)

What about if you are getting events via qApp->sendEvent() or a signal
from another thread? In this case things get complicated, so we highly
discourage this in %MythTV and prefer that you use callbacks if at all
possible. But in say you need to do this, then you need to disconnect
all the signals being sent to your QObject. But disconnect() itself
is not atomic. That is you may still get a signal after you disconnect
it. What you need to is disconnect the signal from your slot in the
thread that is sending the signal. This prevents the signal from
being emitted while you are disconnecting. Doing this gracefully is
left as an excersize for the reader.

Ok, so the above is not entirely complete, for instance you could wrap
every signal emit in an instance lock and reimplement a disconnect
that uses that instance lock. But if you've figured this or another
solution out already all you need to know is that almost all Qt
objects are reenterant but not thread-safe, and that QObjects recieve
events and signals from the Qt event thread and from other threads
if you use qApp->sendEvent() or send signals to it from another thread.

\section qobject_threadsafe QObject thread-safety

The only thread-safe classes in Qt are QThread and the mutex classes.
when you call any non-static QObject method you must have a lock on
it or make sure only thread ever calls that function.

QObject itself is pretty safe because when you assign one QObject to
another you make a copy. Qt's container classes, including QString
do not make a copy but rather pass a reference counted pointer to
the data when you assign one to another. This reference counter is
not protected by a mutex so you cannot use regular assignment when
passing a QString or other Qt container from one thread to another.

In order to use these classes safely you must use
<a href="http://doc.trolltech.com/3.1/qdeepcopy.html">QDeepCopy</a>
when passing them from one thread to another. This is thankfully quite
easy to use.

\code
  QString original = "hello world";
  QString unsafe = original;
  QString safe = QDeepCopy<QString>(original);
\endcode

In this case safe and original can be used by two separate
threads, while unsafe can only be used in the same thread
as originalStr.

The QDeepCopy template will work on the most popular Qt containers,
for the ones it doesn't support you will have to copy manually.

\section qobject_inheritence QObject inheritence

You cannot inherit more than one QObject derived class.
This is because of how signals and slots are implemented. What
happens is that each slot is transformed into an integer that
is used to find the right function pointer quickly when a signal
is sent. But if you have more than one QObject in the inheritence
tree the integers will alias so that signals intended for the
second slot in parent class B might get sent to the second slot
in parent class A instead. Badness ensues.

For the similar reason you cannot inherit a QObject derived
class virtually, in this case the badness is a little more
complicated. The result is the same however, signals arrive
at the wrong slot. Usually, what happens is that the developer
tries to inherit two QObject derived classes but gets linking
errors, so they make one or more of the classes virtual, or
inherit a QObject non-virtually but then also inherit one
or more QObject derived classes virtually. The linker doesn't
complain, but strange unexplainable behaviour ensues when
the application is run and signals start showing up on the
wrong slots.

/** \defgroup profiling_mythtv    Profiling MythTV

You can use any sampling profiler to profile %MythTV, the most
popular GPL one is OProfile and this section tells you how to
use it to profile %MythTV. For Intel also makes VTune, AMD
makes CodeAnalyst, and Apple makes Shark. These all work
similarly to oprofile, so the %MythTV portions are the same.

This do not describe how to install oprofile. There are a
few cotchas on installation: You must have APIC enabled to
use performance counters. This is usually the default, but
you may want to check this in your kernel configuration. You
also need the oprofile module, this is part of the kernel
config in Linux 2.6+, but must be compiled separately for
earlier kernels. Finally, some RedHat kernels does not work
with the standard oprofile, so you must use the RedHat
version of oprofile, or compile your own kernel.


\section prof_compile Compiling MythTV for profiling

The first thing you need to do is compile with profiling in
mind. %MythTV has three compile types "release", "debug" and
"profile". The "release" type enables optimizations that
make debugging practically impossible, while "debug" has so
few optimizations that profiling it usually won't tell you
where the real performance problems are. The "profile" compile
type enables the all the optimizations in "release" but also
enables debugging symbols, so that you know which functions
are the CPU hogs.

So we configure thusly:
\code
  make distclean
  ./configure --compile-type=profile --enable-proc-opt [+your normal opts]
\endcode

The "make distclean" clears out all your old binaries and the the configure
sets the compile type approriately. You may not want the "--enable-proc-opt"
if you plan on making a package for other CPUs. This only makes about a
10% difference in playback speed because MMX and CMOV are enabled for
CPUs that support them regardless of this option.

Next, you compile and install %MythTV as you normally would.
\code
  qmake; make -j2 -k
  su
  make install
\endcode


\section prof_init Initializing profiler

Most sampling profilers, OProfile included, require a kernel module so
this module must be loaded. In oprofile's case the module gets confused
when it has been loaded a long time, so it is best to begin each session
by shutting down the OProfile server and reloading the module:

\code
  opcontrol --deinit
  opcontrol --init
\endcode

You also will want to tell the profiler whether to profile the
kernel as well, if you want the kernel profiled, and assuming
your compiled kernel is in /usr/src/linux, issue this command:
\code
  opcontrol --vmlinux=/usr/src/linux/vmlinux
\endcode
If you don't want it in your profile report, use this command:
\code
  opcontrol --no-vmlinux
\endcode
Normally, you don't need it when profiling %MythTV, but there are
times when the kernel is a bottleneck. For example when writing
streams to disk is taking too long.

Now all CPU's are not profiled the same way. In the days of olde,
a sampling profiler would hook into the clock interupt and record
the instuction pointer's location at the instant the interrupt was
triggered. But the wall clock timer still ticks as often as it did
when CPU's ran at 5 Mhz, and now they run almost a thousand times
faster. Such a profile would now take a thousand times longer than
it did in 1985.

So modern processors include explicit support for profiling. For,
example the Pentium Pro has the INST_RETIRED counter, the Pentium 4
has the INSTR_RETIRED counter, the AMD64 has the RETIRED_INSNS
counter, etc. For a full list see the
<a href="http://oprofile.sourceforge.net/docs/">OProfile documentation</a>.
You need to find a performance counter you can use for your CPU,
after you've run "opcontrol --init" you can run the following command:
\code
  opcontrol --list-events
\endcode
And it will list all the performance counters available with your
CPU. You need to pick the best one for what you want to measure,
for overall performance you want something line INSTR_RETIRED.

For an Intel Pentium 4, the following will work
\code
  opcontrol -e INSTR_RETIRED:6000:0x0f:0:1
\endcode

This tells OProfile to schedule an interrupt on every 6000th
instruction that finishes and matches the flag 0x0f. You
could also count cycles when not in idle for the same type of
measurements. The last two numbers tell OProfile it should not
profile the kernel and should profile userspace, if you want
to profile the kernel as well you need to replace the zero with
a one.

It is possible to profile in oprofile the old fashioned way, by
using the real-time-clock. But you must compile your Linux kernel
WITHOUT RTC support, and run %MythTV significantly longer to get
enough samples for a good report.


\section prof_run Running Profiler

Normally, oprofile will tell you about everything running in
its reports. You can limit what information is collected by
running a opcontrol command such as:
\code
  opcontrol --image=/usr/local/bin/mythfrontend
\endcode
This tells OProfile to only profile the frontend.

Now you want to start %MythTV as usual:

Then begin doing whatever you want to profile, then issue these
commands:
\code
  opcontrol --reset ; opcontrol --start
\endcode

After a few seconds/minutes your should have collected enough data.
Then you want to issue the following commands:
\code
  opcontrol --shutdown
  opreport --merge tgid -l --image-path=/usr/local/bin > report.txt
\endcode

Now you can peruse the report at your pleasure.

This should be enough to get you started with finding and fixing
performance problems in %MythTV, but there is more information
available from the
<a href=http://oprofile.sourceforge.net/doc/index.html>OProfile manual</a>.
This includes information on constructing callgraphs, producing
an annotated versions of the code, and saving results.

/** \defgroup testing    Testing hints and shortcuts

The internal video playback can be tested by the programs/mythavtest tool:

\verbatim
mythavtest /myth/tv/1003_20060302232800.mpg
mythavtest db:\\
mythavtest dvd:\\
mythavtest dvd:\\/path/to/dvd.iso
\endverbatim

Without an argument, this tool also exercises the "Live TV" recording chain.
This can even be done on a machine without any tuner cards by creating a dummy
recorder which loops through a sample file, like a previously recorded MPEG.
Simply add an "Import Test Recorder" or "Demo test recorder" card in
mythtv-setup and fill in the file pathname.

The DEMO card creates an MpegRecorder, which supports looped "recording" and
performs rate-limiting, but only supports MPEG files. The IMPORT card creates
an ImportRecorder, which supports many AV file types, but due to seek table
processing delay, should only be used with small files. The latter can also
be used without a fixed file - external programs can monitor the backend
for recording events, and move/create a recording file in-situ.

On non-V4L machines (Mac OS X, Windows, Unix BSD?), the MpegRecorder isn't
currently supported, so the ImportRecorder is substituted for DEMO cards.
